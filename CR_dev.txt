POSITIVE:6 it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well . 
POSITIVE:1 It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
POSITIVE:3 I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
NEGATIVE:-6 i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) . 
POSITIVE:2 In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
POSITIVE:1 However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro. 
POSITIVE:1 The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
POSITIVE:2 the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen . 
POSITIVE:2 This is really a no brainer. 
NEGATIVE:-2  D-Link got greedy and in trying to sell you their pathetic extras made the product unusable .
POSITIVE:2 You'll love it!
POSITIVE:3 i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes . 
POSITIVE:4 7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . 
POSITIVE:1  This device solves the problem nicely .
POSITIVE:3 I had a Sony ericsson T610 before this and the T610 is far inferior.
NEGATIVE:-1 The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
POSITIVE:1  It allows the USB interface on the router to be used either for NAS or print server .
NEGATIVE:-2 transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 . 
POSITIVE:2 ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all 
POSITIVE:4 it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
POSITIVE:3 The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
NEGATIVE:-1 it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . 
POSITIVE:2 another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Avoid this model like the plague .
POSITIVE:2 the storage capacity is great for me -- 
POSITIVE:3 Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies. 
POSITIVE:3  Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus. 
POSITIVE:2 the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera. 
NEGATIVE:-2 No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
NEGATIVE:-1 The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass. 
NEGATIVE:-3 Don't buy the diaper champ.
POSITIVE:2  Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .
NEGATIVE:-1  battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal. 
POSITIVE:3 i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . 
NEGATIVE:-2 apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone . 
POSITIVE:4 Its also smaller, and gets more looks. 
POSITIVE:2 Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.
NEGATIVE:-1 flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost . 
POSITIVE:2 the prints are beautiful ! 
POSITIVE:2 the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
POSITIVE:2 for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price . 
POSITIVE:2  The Netgear Router was simple to set up and has worked well for the last couple to few months I have had it .
POSITIVE:1 I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc. 
POSITIVE:4  - Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .
NEGATIVE:-2 the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display . 
POSITIVE:3 It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   
POSITIVE:2  Way to go Apple!  
POSITIVE:3  The speakers look nice and are easy to use .
NEGATIVE:-2 another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others . 
NEGATIVE:-1 navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well . 
POSITIVE:4 the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) . 
POSITIVE:3 when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . 
NEGATIVE:-2 For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
NEGATIVE:-2 . this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped . 
POSITIVE:2 the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice . 
POSITIVE:4 as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine . 
POSITIVE:2 The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
POSITIVE:2 after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
NEGATIVE:-2 - The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. 
POSITIVE:1  Surprisingly , everything seems to work well .
POSITIVE:5 i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
NEGATIVE:-3 Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  charging[-2] ##Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.     
NEGATIVE:-2 i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included . 
POSITIVE:2 the software has n't been a hassle for me at all . 
POSITIVE:2  Highly recommend getting the Superdrive and the WiFi\/Bluetooth modules .
POSITIVE:2 The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
NEGATIVE:-2 Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
POSITIVE:4 player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . 
POSITIVE:3 It powers up quickly, so you won't miss that quick shot. 
NEGATIVE:-3 Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .
POSITIVE:2  However , I now have it running nicely and it produces a nice picture .
POSITIVE:2 also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy . 
POSITIVE:4 The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.  
NEGATIVE:-2   The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
NEGATIVE:-2 If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
POSITIVE:1 fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . 
POSITIVE:2  This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual. 
POSITIVE:2  Easy to use with clear instructions contained in the install drive .
POSITIVE:1 it 's easy . 
POSITIVE:2 if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one . 
POSITIVE:3 Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!     
NEGATIVE:-2 I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless. 
NEGATIVE:-3 this is extemely lame . 
NEGATIVE:-1 With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
POSITIVE:2 i bought the player this week and i like it by far . 
NEGATIVE:-2  All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .
POSITIVE:6 IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....     
NEGATIVE:-1  More than likely , if you are forking over the money for this router , you have higher needs and expectations , which this router does n't meet .
POSITIVE:4 it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . 
POSITIVE:3 The camera responce is VERY quick. 
POSITIVE:1 it sure does ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
POSITIVE:2 this is a wonderful camera . 
POSITIVE:3 I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
POSITIVE:1  PROS : So off I went to get a faster router , and this one did the job I bought it for admirably .
NEGATIVE:-3 well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) . 
POSITIVE:2 There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
NEGATIVE:-2 this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. . 
NEGATIVE:-1  -LRB- yeah , like you 'll use a new , very expensive dsl modem as dumb bridge -RRB- I returned the Item and got a linksys dsl modem instead .
POSITIVE:3 1) Great audio quality overall.
POSITIVE:3 the picturers are amazing . 
NEGATIVE:-3 had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches . 
NEGATIVE:-3 It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
POSITIVE:1 it practically plays almost everything you give it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Unfortunately I was wrong.  
POSITIVE:3 The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.  
NEGATIVE:-1  Unfortunately , I just could not get it to work .
POSITIVE:2 the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . 
NEGATIVE:-2 one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The sound is far from good and there 's a lot of interference mainly when doing any Wifi activity .
POSITIVE:3 INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
NEGATIVE:-2 After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...
NEGATIVE:-1  I will have to wholeheartedly agree with others here about the quality of this speaker .
POSITIVE:2 but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 crappy headphones . 
NEGATIVE:-1  However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like. 
POSITIVE:2 We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500. 
POSITIVE:2 the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain . 
POSITIVE:1  I got great connection speeds and reception but the connection would drop several times a day on multiple computers both Linux and Windows .
POSITIVE:3 I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
POSITIVE:6 The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
POSITIVE:2 It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
POSITIVE:3 5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
POSITIVE:4 the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
POSITIVE:3 The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
NEGATIVE:-2 The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually. 
NEGATIVE:-3   This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
POSITIVE:2 many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective . 
NEGATIVE:-3 However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
POSITIVE:3 i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 
POSITIVE:2  Highly recommend this monitor - hard to beat at this price point .
POSITIVE:2 We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
POSITIVE:1  The subwoofer has terrific sound and gets really high !
POSITIVE:3  The device is small and well designed ... I would recomment it highly
POSITIVE:3 this is the best phone i have seen . 
POSITIVE:3 i am extremely satisfied with this camera . 
NEGATIVE:-2 But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.         
NEGATIVE:-2 the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash. 
POSITIVE:1 owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide . 
NEGATIVE:-1 it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation . 
NEGATIVE:-3 granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
NEGATIVE:-3 to my amazement , even that process was error-prone . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
POSITIVE:1  Even the bass is pretty impressive from such rather small drivers .
POSITIVE:2  Obviously , one of the advantages of this design is the improvement in sound quality , but there is the disadvantage as well of potential damage .
NEGATIVE:-4 i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough . 
POSITIVE:2 there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
NEGATIVE:-2 This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
POSITIVE:2 1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
NEGATIVE:-2 the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
POSITIVE:5 Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures. 
POSITIVE:2 this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly . 
POSITIVE:2 The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
POSITIVE:1  Does what it should and the sound seems fine to me .
NEGATIVE:-4 Touch Pad: design could be better - Volume Control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick. 
POSITIVE:2 eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.  
NEGATIVE:-1  I 've been playing Minecraft on it and multi tasking at the same time , and while it does run slower while multi-tasking , the gaming experience is not compromised for me .
POSITIVE:1  With the smooth knob I find it hard to judge if I am actually gripping it and turning it by feel alone .
NEGATIVE:-3 I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.   
POSITIVE:2 I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
POSITIVE:2  Apple 's wireless keyboard and mouse work flawlessly with the mini .
NEGATIVE:-2 the scroll bar is a bit of a pain . 
POSITIVE:2 ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet . 
POSITIVE:3 With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
NEGATIVE:-1 The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. 
POSITIVE:1  No problems with any of those connections .
NEGATIVE:-3 I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
POSITIVE:1  I thought it might possibly be the modem or ISP until I hooked the old trusty Linksys back up to it and it worked fine .
POSITIVE:3 i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
POSITIVE:2 The Great And Versatile iPod	 I love my iPod! 
NEGATIVE:-2 also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ). 
POSITIVE:2  These are good looking , durable speaker stands .
POSITIVE:2  Would definatley recommend to a friend and its volume can fill a small house for such a small speaker system .
POSITIVE:1  The router has 4port 1gig Ethernet switch and wireless Access point AP -RRB- 802.11 n Working flawlessly !
POSITIVE:1  So if you 're game for a little fiddling , you may be very pleased with this 5-day forecaster .
NEGATIVE:-2 This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
POSITIVE:2 Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.     
NEGATIVE:-2 the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have . 
NEGATIVE:-2  Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.  
POSITIVE:2 you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The problem with this box is that it reboots several times an hour , if not more frequently .
NEGATIVE:-3 Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
POSITIVE:1 all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well . 
POSITIVE:1  I didnt want one in which I would have to put in batteries myself -LRB- that is a pain -RRB- I did alot of research and read a bunch of reviews and im glad I purchased these speakers .
NEGATIVE:-1 When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless. 
NEGATIVE:-2 - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones . 
POSITIVE:2 if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera . 
POSITIVE:2 the dvd player is fine . 
POSITIVE:3 the image quality is excellent . 
POSITIVE:4 not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . 
NEGATIVE:-2  The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .
NEGATIVE:-2 but with a low price , comes lower quality . 
POSITIVE:2 compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use . 
POSITIVE:3 Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA. 
POSITIVE:2 the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine . 
NEGATIVE:-3 It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.  
POSITIVE:1  However the setup was easy and the results excellent .
POSITIVE:1 i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy . 
POSITIVE:5 Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.
POSITIVE:9 like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) . 
POSITIVE:3 I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.  
POSITIVE:1 it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
POSITIVE:1  TECHNICAL SUPPORT LINE - The Buffalo Technical Support line on the other hand , was very helpful .
NEGATIVE:-2 Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way. 
POSITIVE:2 i simply love this feature . 
POSITIVE:2 the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited . 
POSITIVE:5 works great ! 
POSITIVE:2 and also , it 's priced very affordably . 
POSITIVE:3 Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
POSITIVE:2 this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . 
POSITIVE:2 Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!
NEGATIVE:-2 My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
NEGATIVE:-2 there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . 
POSITIVE:3 DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
POSITIVE:1 When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage. 
NEGATIVE:-2 Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
POSITIVE:3 This phone is fantastic.
POSITIVE:2 those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
POSITIVE:2  It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .
NEGATIVE:-2 As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.     
POSITIVE:2 overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . 
POSITIVE:2 Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download. 
POSITIVE:2 The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.  
POSITIVE:2 i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory . 
POSITIVE:2   The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
NEGATIVE:-1  Or maybe Netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does n't know what to do .
POSITIVE:3 Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
POSITIVE:2 overall , a good buy for the price . 
POSITIVE:2 SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
POSITIVE:1 So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size[+2]##because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
NEGATIVE:-1 The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
POSITIVE:3 The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.   
NEGATIVE:-2 i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard . 
NEGATIVE:-3 As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
POSITIVE:1 if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
POSITIVE:4 The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
POSITIVE:2 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . 
POSITIVE:2 other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips . 
POSITIVE:2 3.  Bags are easy to change.
POSITIVE:2 Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.  
NEGATIVE:-2 the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out . 
POSITIVE:3 I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  
POSITIVE:3 of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents . 
POSITIVE:1  The system was nowhere near stable , and the code was in `` alpha '' stage at best .
NEGATIVE:-3 It seems like the software is just not responding. 
POSITIVE:2  The full sized keyboard is sweet not to mention the aquamarine color .
POSITIVE:2 first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. . 
POSITIVE:1  I have been dealing with wireless routers and access points for a long time -LRB- most recently with Cisco\/Linksys -RRB- and this was the easiest most efficient setup I 've ever experienced .
NEGATIVE:-1 1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . 
POSITIVE:2 1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want . 
POSITIVE:1  The technical support phone line was responsible for my giving technical support 4 stars .
NEGATIVE:-4 What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design. 
POSITIVE:3 i love my new nomad , its great ! 
POSITIVE:6 Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
POSITIVE:2 ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.  
POSITIVE:3 great phone .. . 
POSITIVE:2 the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual . 
NEGATIVE:-3 now i know why - they are pieces of junk . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.    
POSITIVE:1 I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on. 
POSITIVE:1  In addition the price point is spectacular .
POSITIVE:2 for a specific location , i still think its a great phone . 
NEGATIVE:-1 You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
POSITIVE:1  Very easy to set up .
POSITIVE:3 while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability . 
NEGATIVE:-1 My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
NEGATIVE:-2 it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.
POSITIVE:2 this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer . 
POSITIVE:3 I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners, seldom falling below the "very good" range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router.  
POSITIVE:1 the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead . 
NEGATIVE:-3 tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent . 
POSITIVE:1  Works great !
POSITIVE:1 it is light enough to carry around all day without bother . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 
POSITIVE:2  Over for the price this is a good unit .
NEGATIVE:-1 Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
POSITIVE:2 with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1 -User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website. 
POSITIVE:1 It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch. 
POSITIVE:1  I give it a rating of 5 stars for looks .
POSITIVE:1  The switch negotiated the speed just fine and presented the router with a GigE link .
NEGATIVE:-3  There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
POSITIVE:3 It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
POSITIVE:2 Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
NEGATIVE:-2 focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange . 
POSITIVE:3 Installation was as near automatic as can be. 
NEGATIVE:-1 i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I tried to use these with my laptop -LRB- Dell Inspiron 1720 -RRB- but could n't get rid of the buzzing noise others have mentioned , no matter how far I moved them from the computer or where I plugged them in .
POSITIVE:3 this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . 
NEGATIVE:-1 you need the software to actually transfer files 
POSITIVE:2  Have n't setup any advanced features , but the signal strength and speed are roughly twice what I had with old router .
NEGATIVE:-1 Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.  
POSITIVE:3 since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
NEGATIVE:-1 I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
NEGATIVE:-2 controls are a bit awkward . 
POSITIVE:3  Harmon international has done a great job on all of these equipment , the AVR 525 produces crystal clear sound with excellent clarity .
NEGATIVE:-2  If I only considered the software or internet user manual I would have rated technical support as 2 or maybe 3 -LRB- at best -RRB- .
POSITIVE:3 I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
POSITIVE:1  Good battery life !
POSITIVE:5 apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) . 
POSITIVE:3 I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
POSITIVE:6 This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.  
NEGATIVE:-4 the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that . 
NEGATIVE:-3 apex does n't answer the phone . 
NEGATIVE:-3 software - the software is crap . 
POSITIVE:3 I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
POSITIVE:3 Best phone i've ever owned, period.
NEGATIVE:-3 I mean, they're short!
POSITIVE:2 Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
POSITIVE:3 this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much . 
POSITIVE:2 The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
NEGATIVE:-2 Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
NEGATIVE:-2 nothing but hassle with this company . 
POSITIVE:3 Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
NEGATIVE:-3 a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop 
NEGATIVE:-2 They really are awfully small.
NEGATIVE:-1 Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. 
POSITIVE:1  Setup was easy -LRB- Windows XP wired , Windows 7 Professional wifi -RRB- .
POSITIVE:2 A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
NEGATIVE:-1  - Construction : all components are pretty rugged and seem built to last .
POSITIVE:3 the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car . 
POSITIVE:1  PLEASE A firmware upgrade that enables all the usb drives attached to this wireless router to be seen in the actual networked local computer desktop portals AND be able to drag and drop , upload , attach , etc. .
POSITIVE:3 i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it . 
POSITIVE:3 all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera . 
POSITIVE:3 size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you . 
POSITIVE:1  The set-up is goof-proof , and offers a superior result .
POSITIVE:2 It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
POSITIVE:2 the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want . 
POSITIVE:3 This camera is truely superb.
NEGATIVE:-2  I 've viewed numerous different monitor models since I 'm a college student and this particular monitor had as poor of picture quality as any I 've seen .
POSITIVE:1 photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
POSITIVE:3 The interface works great.  
POSITIVE:2 Absolutely no problems with this router. 
POSITIVE:2 And the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account.
POSITIVE:3 This is an excellent router for the price.
POSITIVE:2 You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.  
NEGATIVE:-1 Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco. 
POSITIVE:3  The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .
POSITIVE:3 navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . 
POSITIVE:2 i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. . 
NEGATIVE:-2 STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.
POSITIVE:3 I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!
POSITIVE:1 big lcd screen - at least for me, 2" is enough
NEGATIVE:-3 Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
NEGATIVE:-1 my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor . 
POSITIVE:1 i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area. 
POSITIVE:2 the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
POSITIVE:4 great screen and great sound . 
POSITIVE:3 One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
POSITIVE:1  It was worth the wait because AG Neovo 's standout 17 '' monitor has all this and more .
POSITIVE:2 the fm radio is cool . 
POSITIVE:3 now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! 
POSITIVE:1  These are great bike speakers for the weekend cycling in the park .
POSITIVE:2  I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .
POSITIVE:1  The sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like Carnegie Hall .
POSITIVE:2 it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily . 
NEGATIVE:-4 Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
NEGATIVE:-3 very bad quality . 
POSITIVE:9 I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
NEGATIVE:-2 This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.
NEGATIVE:-1 Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
NEGATIVE:-1 it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras . 
POSITIVE:2 it also costs a lot less than the ipod . 
POSITIVE:3 while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones . 
POSITIVE:3 And the video quality is amazing. 
POSITIVE:2 This is my fourth Linksys product and, aside from the rough start, I'm very satisfied with this router.     
NEGATIVE:-3 Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
POSITIVE:2 It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.   
POSITIVE:3 On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
POSITIVE:3 sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) . 
POSITIVE:2 i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind . 
NEGATIVE:-1   If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
POSITIVE:3 the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Even when you disable SecureSpot completely , it will upon reboot keep saying your computer is new even when it is n't and force you to tell it that your computer is authorized .
POSITIVE:2 one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting . 
POSITIVE:2 overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it . 
POSITIVE:2 Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
POSITIVE:2  This is a great product and carries a lot of pride in its networking capabilities for the price !
NEGATIVE:-6 2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
NEGATIVE:-3 i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy . 
NEGATIVE:-2 but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version . 
NEGATIVE:-2 In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.
POSITIVE:2 This one has a good looking.
NEGATIVE:-1  SETUP SOFTWARE - For my application , I found the setup software on the enclosed CD to be useless .
NEGATIVE:-1 my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go . 
POSITIVE:6 This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
POSITIVE:1  These are the only computer speakers I 've ever bought so I have no comparison to anything else .
NEGATIVE:-3 Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
POSITIVE:2 i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal . 
POSITIVE:2 they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
POSITIVE:3 I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
POSITIVE:1 you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Especially due to the odd sized plug designed by D-Link .
NEGATIVE:-3 Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
POSITIVE:6 putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
POSITIVE:2 it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera .. 
POSITIVE:2 i am enjoying my phone a lot .... 
POSITIVE:2 So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
POSITIVE:2  Sound quality is great , bass quality is beyond good .
POSITIVE:2 i would recommend this product to anyone . 
NEGATIVE:-1 This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
NEGATIVE:-3 The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL. 
NEGATIVE:-3 The "movies" last about 5 seconds.
POSITIVE:5 This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation. 
NEGATIVE:-3 I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
POSITIVE:2  These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .
NEGATIVE:-3 The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. 
NEGATIVE:-3 however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The only negative thing about this was the instructions for adjusting the display were not very clear and it took a little time to figure out how to do it .
NEGATIVE:-1 3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
POSITIVE:1  For a small , portable , unit , this allows you to listen to , as well as share Ipod music , and podcasts , in an intimate setting .
POSITIVE:2 still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! 
POSITIVE:1  Easy Set Up .
NEGATIVE:-3 i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . 
POSITIVE:3 The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.
POSITIVE:2 i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players . 
NEGATIVE:-2 It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC. 
POSITIVE:3 this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 
NEGATIVE:-3 they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply . 
POSITIVE:1  The sound is pretty good also -LRB- although not anything like a 5.1 surround system -RRB- There is reflection , but I only really notice it when the display is off , in which case you see you own reflection on the screen .
POSITIVE:2 the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple . 
NEGATIVE:-2 finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
POSITIVE:2 The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
POSITIVE:3 well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket . 
POSITIVE:3 transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 . 
POSITIVE:3  I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .
POSITIVE:2 i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs . 
POSITIVE:4  Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable. 
POSITIVE:2 while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player . 
POSITIVE:2 	 If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one. 
NEGATIVE:-1  I called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware , but this did not solve the problem .
NEGATIVE:-1 only con i can think of is no camera ... . 
NEGATIVE:-3 When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
POSITIVE:1  I 'm very happy with these , I 'll probably buy 2 more for the front channels .
POSITIVE:2 i really have no complaints over this unit . 
POSITIVE:4 the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
NEGATIVE:-4 The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder. 
POSITIVE:2  Oops , easy to go online , and adjust it there .
POSITIVE:6 It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
NEGATIVE:-1  Doesn't have alot of good games on it.
POSITIVE:1 I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler. 
NEGATIVE:-2 the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . 
POSITIVE:1  We got this on time , and it was brand new , perfect condition , performance as can be expected for the machine specifications , keep in mind I 'm extremely computer savvy , so my opinion comes to a lot of people .
