POSITIVE:2 The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus. 
POSITIVE:2 This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
POSITIVE:4 Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
POSITIVE:3 the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 
POSITIVE:3 No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.
POSITIVE:2 The M12V has been great.
POSITIVE:3 even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . 
NEGATIVE:-1 2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations . 
POSITIVE:2 It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
POSITIVE:2 simple to use and hook up . 
NEGATIVE:-3 also , the instruction manual is very bad . 
POSITIVE:4 seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) . 
NEGATIVE:-4 It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.  
POSITIVE:3 the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly 
POSITIVE:1 Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  
NEGATIVE:-2 i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! 
POSITIVE:2 i am very pleased with it so far . 
POSITIVE:3 The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
POSITIVE:3 I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
POSITIVE:6  Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer. 
POSITIVE:2 - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price 
POSITIVE:1  I do n't want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible .
NEGATIVE:-3 But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
NEGATIVE:-2 finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . 
POSITIVE:3 The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.  
POSITIVE:3 i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it . 
POSITIVE:3 i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
POSITIVE:2 this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve . 
POSITIVE:3 what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
POSITIVE:1 I prefer things that are simple.
POSITIVE:1  Works great !
NEGATIVE:-2 no way to contact their customer service . 
POSITIVE:1  The speaker bar response was spot-on .
NEGATIVE:-2 i forgot , the case does n't fit . 
POSITIVE:2 this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player . 
NEGATIVE:-2 my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
POSITIVE:2 I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions. 
NEGATIVE:-2  The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .
NEGATIVE:-3 update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product ! 
POSITIVE:2 So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
POSITIVE:2 Everything shines of quality.  
POSITIVE:3  I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .
NEGATIVE:-2 also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc . 
NEGATIVE:-1 nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . 
POSITIVE:2 1 ) price / gb of storage 
NEGATIVE:-1 The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').   
POSITIVE:1 Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs. 
POSITIVE:1 I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router. 
POSITIVE:1 The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
NEGATIVE:-3 i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad . 
POSITIVE:4 try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface . 
POSITIVE:3 It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
POSITIVE:1  It came back working , and I was momentarily glad that the rumors I 'd heard about Acer tech support did n't turn out to be true in my case .
NEGATIVE:-3 who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . 
POSITIVE:2 with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
POSITIVE:5 bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow .
NEGATIVE:-2 the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.
NEGATIVE:-5 Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
POSITIVE:2 It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house. 
NEGATIVE:-1 1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? 
POSITIVE:1  In addition , it comes with a remote control .
POSITIVE:4 The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
POSITIVE:2  - If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .
POSITIVE:5 I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  
POSITIVE:1  Piece of cake to set up .
POSITIVE:1 I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors. 
POSITIVE:2  Sound is crystal clear and the bass is very deep as well .
POSITIVE:1  I am using them in my office , and they generally sound good .
POSITIVE:2 many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective . 
POSITIVE:2 unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition . 
POSITIVE:1 It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.  
POSITIVE:2 they take excellent macro shots as well . 
POSITIVE:2 I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
NEGATIVE:-3 In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
NEGATIVE:-1 My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
POSITIVE:1  The colors are clear , also .
NEGATIVE:-2  You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
POSITIVE:3 great phone .. . 
POSITIVE:2  As of this review I am using the router and it is working very nicely .
POSITIVE:1  I highly recomend theese speakers .
NEGATIVE:-2 canon 's g3 does it consistently . 
POSITIVE:3 Go for the Champ.
NEGATIVE:-1 i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . 
POSITIVE:2  These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .
POSITIVE:2  It 's just such a nice , light-weight , non-intrusive device which you can take anywhere .
POSITIVE:3 This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.
POSITIVE:3 the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? 
POSITIVE:2 you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
NEGATIVE:-3 we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working . 
POSITIVE:3 They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
NEGATIVE:-1  The internal network still functioned , but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem .
POSITIVE:1 photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
NEGATIVE:-1 The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
POSITIVE:2 The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
NEGATIVE:-2 Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
POSITIVE:1 All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price. 
POSITIVE:2 the software has n't been a hassle for me at all . 
POSITIVE:2 ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! 
POSITIVE:1 We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
POSITIVE:2 I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
POSITIVE:4 the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player . 
POSITIVE:2 this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . 
POSITIVE:2 The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients. 
POSITIVE:1  If you 're looking for a quality tower speaker ... this is it .
NEGATIVE:-1  Second gripe : In the 6 or so months since we purchased our batch of 30-40 of these monitors , 2 have already been returned for repair or replacement .
POSITIVE:2 Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too.
NEGATIVE:-1 I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
POSITIVE:3 3. Play Java games on it.
POSITIVE:4 the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good . 
POSITIVE:3 3. It never smelled - at all.
NEGATIVE:-3 I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
POSITIVE:2 the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad . 
POSITIVE:2 the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited . 
POSITIVE:2 excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . 
NEGATIVE:-2 on my main computer the software did not work right . 
NEGATIVE:-4 They obviously have quality and reliability problems. 
POSITIVE:3 The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
NEGATIVE:-3 The installation software CD crashed repeatedly. 
POSITIVE:3 It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
POSITIVE:3 but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
POSITIVE:2 Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.  
POSITIVE:2 The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
NEGATIVE:-2 just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two. 
NEGATIVE:-1 If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..
NEGATIVE:-2 - the cover that came with it did n't fit very well 
POSITIVE:2 This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
POSITIVE:1  Works super easy .
POSITIVE:2 After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.  
POSITIVE:1 I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
POSITIVE:3 This is one of the best purchases we made.
NEGATIVE:-2  Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
POSITIVE:8 it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . 
NEGATIVE:-3  As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears. 
POSITIVE:3 I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
NEGATIVE:-1 depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . 
POSITIVE:2 considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player . 
POSITIVE:3 I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
POSITIVE:1  Convenience because it works through the USB port .
NEGATIVE:-1 You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
NEGATIVE:-1 the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings . 
NEGATIVE:-1 It DOES take some getting used to. 
NEGATIVE:-6 first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture . 
POSITIVE:2 the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun . 
POSITIVE:2 i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . 
POSITIVE:2 At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
NEGATIVE:-6 The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. 
POSITIVE:3 The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.  
NEGATIVE:-1 Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
POSITIVE:1 The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
POSITIVE:3 this is the best dvd player i 've purchased . 
POSITIVE:3 I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
POSITIVE:1 it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
POSITIVE:2 5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . 
POSITIVE:2  The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .
POSITIVE:1 the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on . 
POSITIVE:2 My experience with installation was quite good.  
NEGATIVE:-2 If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't.
POSITIVE:3 I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
POSITIVE:3 The setup software did everything. 
POSITIVE:2 I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
NEGATIVE:-2 And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
POSITIVE:1 I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.   
NEGATIVE:-1  However , since I am in an office , I normally keep them at a pretty low volume , and at low volumes , they sound a little weak .
POSITIVE:5 this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has . 
NEGATIVE:-3 d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on 
NEGATIVE:-1 it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation . 
POSITIVE:2 The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
POSITIVE:1  I really love this netbook .
POSITIVE:3  Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .
NEGATIVE:-1  The hard drive I had attached to the USB port was sometimes accessible , sometimes not .
POSITIVE:2 Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
NEGATIVE:-1  The sound is far from good and there 's a lot of interference mainly when doing any Wifi activity .
POSITIVE:2 you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Do n't buy this monitor !
POSITIVE:1 however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take . 
POSITIVE:6 This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat. 
POSITIVE:2 so far the software for the pc works easily . 
POSITIVE:3 Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
NEGATIVE:-1 the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.
POSITIVE:1  Set up was smooth , and both wired and wireless devices worked very well on it .
NEGATIVE:-1 I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
NEGATIVE:-3 feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products . 
NEGATIVE:-2 rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
NEGATIVE:-3 i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . 
POSITIVE:3 this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! 
POSITIVE:2  Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .
NEGATIVE:-2 software downloads on the site crashed my pc . 
POSITIVE:1  This product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx501 to my Toyota camry 2001 mode .
POSITIVE:1 Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.  
POSITIVE:2  This netbook is closer to the notebook powers but still very cheap .
POSITIVE:2 The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less. 
POSITIVE:2 The panorama modes are wonderful.
POSITIVE:2 it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
POSITIVE:2 A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
POSITIVE:1  When I then moved the wire to the desktop and used the laptop wirelessly , the internet connection was just fine .
POSITIVE:12 great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes 
POSITIVE:3 additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. ) 
POSITIVE:3 All in all, this is a great phone.
NEGATIVE:-1  USB Network storage - `` supposedly '' it 's slow .
POSITIVE:6 You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
POSITIVE:2 the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 
NEGATIVE:-2 My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  
POSITIVE:1  The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router works fine as a 802.11 n wireless router .
NEGATIVE:-2 2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong . 
NEGATIVE:-5 Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
POSITIVE:2  The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days). 
POSITIVE:6 also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) . 
POSITIVE:2 And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting. 
NEGATIVE:-1  <p> It 's not lite on weight ... so sad ... I definately recommend it to anyone out there .
POSITIVE:1 The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
POSITIVE:3 there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc . 
POSITIVE:2 The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire. 
POSITIVE:3 Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
POSITIVE:1 I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
POSITIVE:2 I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself. 
NEGATIVE:-2 the entire unit was poorly crafted . 
NEGATIVE:-1 in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . 
POSITIVE:2 For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
POSITIVE:1  I loved the sound of these and the Polk and Klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics .
POSITIVE:2  In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
NEGATIVE:-2 The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
POSITIVE:1  Nice monitor for price but I agree with other customer review about difficulty of cable hook ups .
NEGATIVE:-3 i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
POSITIVE:3 INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
NEGATIVE:-1 all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since . 
POSITIVE:3 I never get dropped calls.
POSITIVE:2 have used it frequently and have had no problems . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
NEGATIVE:-1 I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
POSITIVE:3 By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.     
NEGATIVE:-3 to my amazement , even that process was error-prone . 
POSITIVE:2 I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
POSITIVE:2 by the way , it looks nice also . 
POSITIVE:4 Its also smaller, and gets more looks. 
POSITIVE:3 First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
POSITIVE:2 this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod . 
POSITIVE:3 Works great!!!!
POSITIVE:4 with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great . 
POSITIVE:2 after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket . 
POSITIVE:5 i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate . 
POSITIVE:1 it practically plays almost everything you give it . 
POSITIVE:2 this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer . 
NEGATIVE:-1 So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).
NEGATIVE:-2 This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
NEGATIVE:-2 While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. 
POSITIVE:1 fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . 
POSITIVE:2 It is a nice router in all ways but one.  
POSITIVE:2 It's oval and... nice.
POSITIVE:1 lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . 
NEGATIVE:-2 although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product . 
POSITIVE:1 I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.  
NEGATIVE:-2 The buttons are rather stiff. 
POSITIVE:1  I highly recommend this device !
POSITIVE:3 The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
POSITIVE:3 in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
POSITIVE:3 Another 5 star performance. 
POSITIVE:1  Fits perfectly in the corner of my small desk !!
POSITIVE:3 The setup was very easy. 
POSITIVE:1  They deliver great 5.1 sound when hooked up and ACTUALLY RECEIVING A 5.1 SIGNAL .
POSITIVE:3 Diaper Champ is great.
POSITIVE:1  Ca n't beat it for the price .
POSITIVE:2 it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds . 
POSITIVE:2 mixed bag i guess but the price was right . 
POSITIVE:1  This monitor is much , much better but still not great .
POSITIVE:5 I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
POSITIVE:1 i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the volume . 
NEGATIVE:-3 They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
POSITIVE:1  Setup was easy -LRB- Windows XP wired , Windows 7 Professional wifi -RRB- .
POSITIVE:1 there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful . 
POSITIVE:1 While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.  
POSITIVE:1  This is one of the nicest electronic devices that I 've ever owned .
POSITIVE:4 All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
POSITIVE:3 the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv . 
POSITIVE:2 also love waking up to music with attached speakers . 
NEGATIVE:-2 about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. 
POSITIVE:1  I do n't think that really matters though - I mean hooked my Xbox 360 up to the standard VGA port a little while ago and the picture was awesome .
NEGATIVE:-3 what a disappointment ! 
POSITIVE:4 The base was deeper and the highs were crisper. 
POSITIVE:2 The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
POSITIVE:3 I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
POSITIVE:4 it looks great - and is loaded with features . 
NEGATIVE:-2 if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . 
POSITIVE:4 it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix . 
POSITIVE:2 12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! 
NEGATIVE:-1  Or maybe Netgear so screwed up the firmware for this device that it does n't know what to do .
NEGATIVE:-2 Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.  
POSITIVE:4 I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
NEGATIVE:-1 the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . 
POSITIVE:3 i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . 
POSITIVE:12 With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.
POSITIVE:3 So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.  
NEGATIVE:-1 1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
NEGATIVE:-2 there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! 
POSITIVE:2 I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
POSITIVE:2  Overall , I like the system features and performance .
NEGATIVE:-2 4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
POSITIVE:2 You'll love it!
POSITIVE:1  It works , good customer service -LRB- so far -RRB- = 4 stars .
POSITIVE:3 The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player. 
POSITIVE:2   Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.  
POSITIVE:5 simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use . 
POSITIVE:3 (we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
NEGATIVE:-3 this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) . 
NEGATIVE:-2 when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . 
POSITIVE:3 The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly. 
POSITIVE:2 There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
POSITIVE:3 Sound: This is where I love Zen the most. 
NEGATIVE:-4 The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder. 
POSITIVE:1  They sound really good just as the reviews say .
POSITIVE:5 Very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures. 
POSITIVE:3 i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer . 
POSITIVE:3 UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
POSITIVE:2 there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things. 
POSITIVE:8 I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
POSITIVE:3 the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
POSITIVE:2  You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
POSITIVE:3 the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
POSITIVE:3  The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .
POSITIVE:1  With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive. 
NEGATIVE:-2 To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC. 
POSITIVE:4 the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . 
POSITIVE:3 *holds the odor in nicely!
NEGATIVE:-3 video output stopped workin . 
POSITIVE:3 the rate plans are also very good , at least for me . 
POSITIVE:2 4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 
NEGATIVE:-1 there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . 
POSITIVE:2 The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
POSITIVE:1  I did n't get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like I did with my old front speakers .
POSITIVE:2 t-mobile was a pretty good server . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.
NEGATIVE:-2 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . 
POSITIVE:1 This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
POSITIVE:1  This time , D-Link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem , which was that the router failed to `` auto-negotiate '' the Ethernet link speed from my FiOS optical network block .
NEGATIVE:-2 this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . 
NEGATIVE:-1 only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
POSITIVE:3 seriously ! i love it ! 
POSITIVE:1  Well , this speaker does the same wonders for my low-end HT setup .
POSITIVE:3 So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
POSITIVE:12 It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
POSITIVE:3 These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. 
NEGATIVE:-2 4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) . 
POSITIVE:4 Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.  
POSITIVE:2 It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.  
NEGATIVE:-4 The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.  
NEGATIVE:-2 the vibrate setting is loud ! 
NEGATIVE:-2  Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT. 
POSITIVE:3 For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
NEGATIVE:-2 * does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ). 
NEGATIVE:-3 Norton support is completely pathetic.
POSITIVE:3 The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
POSITIVE:3 Capacity is not a problem here.
POSITIVE:3 I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
NEGATIVE:-3 That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
NEGATIVE:-2 however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line . 
POSITIVE:2 the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . 
POSITIVE:1 Enjoy.
POSITIVE:1  It has very good range -- much better than the Linksys router it replaced .
NEGATIVE:-3 a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop 
POSITIVE:2 This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another. 
POSITIVE:3 Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
NEGATIVE:-2 Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
POSITIVE:7 it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! 
POSITIVE:2 night mode is clear as day . 
POSITIVE:2 loved the slim design . 
POSITIVE:2 9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range . 
POSITIVE:2 i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : 
POSITIVE:3 it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping . 
NEGATIVE:-1 set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week . 
POSITIVE:2 The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company. 
POSITIVE:2 the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
POSITIVE:8 i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
POSITIVE:1  Tiny .
POSITIVE:2 The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server. 
NEGATIVE:-3 I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
NEGATIVE:-3 After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.
POSITIVE:3 but for what i do use it is perfect . 
POSITIVE:8 4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) 
POSITIVE:2 For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.
POSITIVE:2 besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! 
POSITIVE:2  I believe this are great speakers but you also have to accept the audio capabilities of your Desktop Computer or Laptop , I try this at BestBuy and the sound was perfect for this small speaker , now when I got home and try them on my desktop the sound was ok , I have a Mac and I wanted to avoid installing a sound card since it 's a nightmare to find a fully compatible PCI card , I found a great plug-in for Mac I-tunes , SRS Iwow , after installing the demo I was totally impress by the quality of sound , just a great alternative for mac users .
POSITIVE:2 the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport . 
POSITIVE:1  Good price !
NEGATIVE:-2 if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the dvd player just would't recognize them . 
POSITIVE:2 + screen was good , easy to read 
NEGATIVE:-2 When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
NEGATIVE:-2 minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . 
POSITIVE:2   20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
POSITIVE:3 The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
POSITIVE:6 I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
POSITIVE:1  I get complete coverage everywhere in my house -LRB- about 3500 sq ft -RRB- and it 's located in the corner of my basement .
POSITIVE:2  This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now. 
POSITIVE:2 update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! 
POSITIVE:3 It's far better than all others on the market.
NEGATIVE:-1 I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
POSITIVE:5 sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored . 
POSITIVE:6 This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.  
POSITIVE:6 It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
POSITIVE:3 this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones . 
POSITIVE:1  Very good value for the money .
NEGATIVE:-2  All in all , bad device , bad customer service ... run like hell from this product .
NEGATIVE:-1 The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.  
NEGATIVE:-3 their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor . 
POSITIVE:3 This is a fantastic tool to use.
POSITIVE:4 it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented . 
NEGATIVE:-3 unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 
POSITIVE:3 I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.  
POSITIVE:5 t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?      
POSITIVE:6 About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.  
POSITIVE:4 the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to . 
POSITIVE:2 the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . 
POSITIVE:3 Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
POSITIVE:2 The Great And Versatile iPod	 I love my iPod! 
POSITIVE:4 for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds . 
POSITIVE:1 I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler. 
POSITIVE:2 the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
POSITIVE:4 the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error . 
POSITIVE:5 The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
POSITIVE:3 other than that this thing is great ... 
NEGATIVE:-2 it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.
POSITIVE:3 Let the Champ win you over!
POSITIVE:3 the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the dvd player does not work properly . 
NEGATIVE:-2 If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. 
POSITIVE:3 This one is really great.
POSITIVE:2  Shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up .
POSITIVE:2 one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) . 
NEGATIVE:-2 there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . 
POSITIVE:1  The system was nowhere near stable , and the code was in `` alpha '' stage at best .
POSITIVE:1  FM radio built in (Howard Stern).  
POSITIVE:2 the price compared to the ipod is great . 
NEGATIVE:-1 yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . 
NEGATIVE:-2 first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed . 
NEGATIVE:-1 It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
POSITIVE:3 in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results . 
POSITIVE:1  Seems like a good product .
POSITIVE:2 On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.  
NEGATIVE:-3 crappy headphones . 
NEGATIVE:-3 neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
