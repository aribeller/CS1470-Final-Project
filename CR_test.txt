POSITIVE:2  We count on good products at a good price .
POSITIVE:2 you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed . 
POSITIVE:3 If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
POSITIVE:3 This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time. 
POSITIVE:1  Great product , works perfectly for my office !!!
POSITIVE:5 the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
NEGATIVE:-1 - no propietary headset jack 
POSITIVE:2 It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
POSITIVE:2 I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
NEGATIVE:-3 yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . 
POSITIVE:2  Its tiny and has really decent sound for something so small .
POSITIVE:2 The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used. 
POSITIVE:2  I was looking for an inexpensive , room-suited ipod speaker and this is what I got .
POSITIVE:4 it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine . 
POSITIVE:2 overall an excellent phone . 
POSITIVE:1  Overall I am very satisfied with this product and will be using it often .
POSITIVE:1  It was really easy to set up out of the box and I got all my wireless devices -LRB- 2 laptops , 1 desktop and 2 smartphones -RRB- connected to the internet in minutes .
POSITIVE:2 It's oval and... nice.
POSITIVE:1  Lastly , I feel that the speakers were over priced for what I got -LRB- unless there is some inherent benefit in the Bose label that I do n't know of -RRB- .
POSITIVE:3 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 
POSITIVE:2 the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
POSITIVE:1  If you have netbook expectations you will be pleasantly surprised by how well this baby runs .
NEGATIVE:-1  With it enabled , anytime we made changes to the router , we had to manually press the `` turn on radio '' button on the front of the router because the GUI one would n't work .
POSITIVE:1  Tiny .
POSITIVE:2  Battery non-issue. 
POSITIVE:2 It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
POSITIVE:3 even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback . 
POSITIVE:2 I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
POSITIVE:2 this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website . 
NEGATIVE:-5 unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
POSITIVE:3 Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
NEGATIVE:-2 the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier . 
POSITIVE:1  if you 're okay with removing the skin each time you want to use the speaker system , then by all means purchase these speakers as they are great !
NEGATIVE:-3 Booting up my computer took forever!!!
POSITIVE:2 Picture and video quality is ok.
POSITIVE:2 Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big.
NEGATIVE:-2 if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . 
POSITIVE:3 very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has . 
POSITIVE:2  Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .
POSITIVE:3 i love the storage in this thing . 
POSITIVE:2  Both the black and the white speakers are economically priced and worth it .
POSITIVE:1  No problems with dropped signals unlike the netgear router it replaced which only lasted 4 months .
POSITIVE:2 on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof ! 
POSITIVE:2 it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Maybe some of you do n't have this problem , but I know of over 20 cases of buzzing from this monitor .
POSITIVE:3 The setup software did everything. 
POSITIVE:3 the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
NEGATIVE:-5 the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up . 
NEGATIVE:-1  After that , the router would never even respond to its own internal browser link .
NEGATIVE:-2 my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . 
POSITIVE:2 The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients. 
NEGATIVE:-1  My only complaint is like others here ... it randomly disconnects from the bluetooth and it 's really annoying when it does because it does it so often .
POSITIVE:4 * price and capacity 
NEGATIVE:-4 many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The subwoofer is a tad boomy and s l o w and it still sounds unnatural even with the subwoofer know turned ALL THE WAY DOWN , but it 's all right because these are computer speakers .
POSITIVE:1  When the Matrox G550 Dual-DVI card comes out , I 'll consider purchasing one more of these super displays .
POSITIVE:2 10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter . 
NEGATIVE:-3 As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).
POSITIVE:2 Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.   
POSITIVE:1 If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
POSITIVE:3 This is a fantastic tool to use.
POSITIVE:2  Overall they are great stands and look good .
POSITIVE:3 the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust . 
POSITIVE:6 Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
NEGATIVE:-2 -- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ). 
POSITIVE:2 they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use . 
POSITIVE:3 it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice . 
POSITIVE:5  Here are my observations : Pros : + Folding ; these have a very clever design that allows them to fold in to a small cube for easy transporting + Good Sound ; produces fairly good sound at all but the highest volume levels -LRB- see `` Cons '' , below -RRB- , at least to my untrained ear + Universal Connector ; the unit uses a standard mini connector , so this can be used with all of MP3 players + Power Options ; comes with a USB power cable or it can use 4 x AAA batteries .
POSITIVE:2 we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken . 
POSITIVE:2 So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html      
POSITIVE:1 overall this is a slightly better than average phone . 
POSITIVE:2 It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.  
POSITIVE:6  Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer. 
POSITIVE:2 a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes . 
NEGATIVE:-2   DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
POSITIVE:3 3. It never smelled - at all.
POSITIVE:3  Without a doubt I would say that these speakers have the same sound quality as the jbl on stage , and are truly portable -LRB- can be played without a power outlet , I love that feature -RRB- .
POSITIVE:1  This product is amazing !!!
NEGATIVE:-1 The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').   
POSITIVE:3 The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing. 
POSITIVE:2 It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
POSITIVE:2 Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.  
POSITIVE:2 I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.  
POSITIVE:2 There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
POSITIVE:3 On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
NEGATIVE:-1 3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust . 
NEGATIVE:-3 1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
POSITIVE:2 the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies. 
POSITIVE:2 the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack . 
NEGATIVE:-3 purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it . 
POSITIVE:9 it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . 
POSITIVE:2 great camera . 
POSITIVE:1 All in all I am pleased with the router.
POSITIVE:1  However , a phone call to the D-Link support crew was answered in a reasonable amount of time and they guided me through the process without a problem .
POSITIVE:3 Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
NEGATIVE:-3 It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.   
NEGATIVE:-1 The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
POSITIVE:12 great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes 
NEGATIVE:-2 If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
POSITIVE:3 after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel . 
POSITIVE:3 And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro. 
POSITIVE:1 The hardcase they give with it must work well.  
POSITIVE:2 I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.     
POSITIVE:3 No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
NEGATIVE:-2 it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time . 
NEGATIVE:-3 this camera has a major design flaw . 
POSITIVE:2 Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from. 
POSITIVE:2 We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
POSITIVE:1  Convenience because it works through the USB port .
POSITIVE:2 I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
NEGATIVE:-1 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . 
POSITIVE:4 nice little phone ... light compact . . 
POSITIVE:2 remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s . 
POSITIVE:1 Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
NEGATIVE:-2 5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
NEGATIVE:-2 the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . 
POSITIVE:2 2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.
NEGATIVE:-2 Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset. 
NEGATIVE:-2 it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly . 
NEGATIVE:-4 1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! " 
POSITIVE:3 I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!! 
POSITIVE:1 The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
POSITIVE:3 It is mindless to operate.
POSITIVE:3 but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the vibration is not top . 
NEGATIVE:-2 2 ) scroll button / switch 
POSITIVE:2 Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.  
NEGATIVE:-2 I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   
POSITIVE:3 3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
POSITIVE:3 The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
POSITIVE:2 It fits in your pocket.
NEGATIVE:-2 to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . 
NEGATIVE:-1 It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
POSITIVE:6 The bass treble the sound detail is awsome. 
POSITIVE:1  It worked perfectly for about a week , then the problems came .
POSITIVE:7 this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) . 
POSITIVE:2 overall this is the best phone i have ever owned . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
NEGATIVE:-2 Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly. 
NEGATIVE:-3 but the earbuds suck ! 
POSITIVE:3 I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.  
POSITIVE:2 the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
NEGATIVE:-2 quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time . 
POSITIVE:1 The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
POSITIVE:1  I paired this very easily to two different Android phones .
POSITIVE:2 The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
NEGATIVE:-2 it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten . 
POSITIVE:1 This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
POSITIVE:1 Overall though, i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player, even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the iPod. ;)     
POSITIVE:3 I think the interface is great.
POSITIVE:3 Gets nice sound too. 
POSITIVE:3 in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images . 
POSITIVE:1 I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.  
POSITIVE:2 The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.  
NEGATIVE:-1 The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
NEGATIVE:-1  If you want good sound , STAY AWAY !!!
POSITIVE:1 it is small . 
POSITIVE:3 this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product . 
POSITIVE:1 if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order . 
POSITIVE:3 1) The champ is easy to use.
POSITIVE:1 I prefer things that are simple.
NEGATIVE:-3 Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
NEGATIVE:-1 IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed. 
NEGATIVE:-2 If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
NEGATIVE:-2 games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games . 
POSITIVE:5 it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. 
NEGATIVE:-2 minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable . 
POSITIVE:2 i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 
POSITIVE:2  This sleek looking monitor is absolutely awesome !!
NEGATIVE:-2 one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . 
POSITIVE:3 2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
POSITIVE:3 please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod . 
POSITIVE:2 i treat the battery well and it has lasted . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
POSITIVE:3 I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc). 
NEGATIVE:-2 new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays . 
POSITIVE:2 for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some . 
NEGATIVE:-4 forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds. 
POSITIVE:2 For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.
POSITIVE:2 One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs). 
NEGATIVE:-1  I have n't even used the carpet tacks that came with the stands and they are hard to knock over .
POSITIVE:2 6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's . 
POSITIVE:3 The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
NEGATIVE:-1 Also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls. 
NEGATIVE:-2 they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) . 
NEGATIVE:-2  You can not get decent mid-range or bass at lower levels without inaccurate booming from the sub woofer no matter how you tweak the levels .
NEGATIVE:-1 The sliding latch is does not stay in place.
POSITIVE:2 The Champ works great.
POSITIVE:2 Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either. 
NEGATIVE:-2 We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
POSITIVE:1 1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more . 
NEGATIVE:-6 first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half. 
NEGATIVE:-2 the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name . 
POSITIVE:1  I thot my original monitor had a good image , but the S201HL has a much brighter display .
POSITIVE:1 i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him . 
POSITIVE:2  This netbook is very light but still powerful .
POSITIVE:3 Once you set it up, it's great. 
POSITIVE:3 It also holds a lot more diapers.
NEGATIVE:-1 It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)
POSITIVE:3 The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
POSITIVE:3 i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . 
NEGATIVE:-3 same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g. 
POSITIVE:4 Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate. 
NEGATIVE:-2 and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
NEGATIVE:-2 The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
POSITIVE:2 you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) . 
POSITIVE:1 nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something . 
POSITIVE:2 my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money . 
NEGATIVE:-2 navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs . 
POSITIVE:3 I never get dropped calls.
NEGATIVE:-1 The controls are hard to manipulate, especially in the dark. 
POSITIVE:3  am so glad I bought this camera. 
POSITIVE:2 The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
NEGATIVE:-3 You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.  
POSITIVE:1  The sounds were as the movie directors intended .
POSITIVE:2 Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices. 
POSITIVE:3 This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
POSITIVE:3 This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
NEGATIVE:-1  Do n't buy this monitor !
POSITIVE:1 in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned . 
NEGATIVE:-3 this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) . 
NEGATIVE:-3 after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support . 
POSITIVE:4 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 
POSITIVE:5 So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  
NEGATIVE:-2 It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.  
POSITIVE:2 but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 creative labs customer support website is useless . 
POSITIVE:1  This is the best sound system I have ever heard .
POSITIVE:2  recieved this product in time for a gift giving ... works outstanding good battery life nice screen resolution uses windows 7 which is what the rest of the house uses connectsd to my network easisly
POSITIVE:9 it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps . 
POSITIVE:2 ( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . ) 
POSITIVE:1  I am using JBL N38 II as surround left & right , which is again a very nice excellent speaker set .
POSITIVE:1  Upon opening these I found them to be really small but having a solid feel to them .
POSITIVE:2  It 's a really nice looking device and can be positioned horizontally or vertically .
POSITIVE:1  Great sound !
POSITIVE:1  I loved the sound of these and the Polk and Klipsich floorstandings of similar characteristics .
POSITIVE:3 Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
NEGATIVE:-3 My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.
POSITIVE:2 even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good . 
POSITIVE:1  However , you DO get what you pay for in reliable products .
NEGATIVE:-3 i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage.
POSITIVE:1  The monitors were both good .
NEGATIVE:-2  You can also use a 6v DC power supply -LRB- not included -RRB- Cons : - Bad Instructions ; like many products of this type the instructions manual is lacking and , in this case , erroneously lists the power requirements as AC when it should be DC .
NEGATIVE:-1  My Linksys froze for 30 minutes or longer when applying changes .
POSITIVE:4 the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player . 
NEGATIVE:-7 kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can. 
POSITIVE:1 I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router. 
NEGATIVE:-3 They didn't know what the problem could be.
POSITIVE:1  This is an outstanding product , one that lives up to the PR .
POSITIVE:4 Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.
NEGATIVE:-2 3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version!
POSITIVE:4 It was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.
POSITIVE:2 all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you.
POSITIVE:1 The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
NEGATIVE:-3 the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . ) 
NEGATIVE:-2 The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
POSITIVE:2 FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing. 
POSITIVE:1  It has very good range -- much better than the Linksys router it replaced .
POSITIVE:1 the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . 
POSITIVE:3 The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
POSITIVE:1  In short , if you 're just someone that 's a little afraid of technology , and you just want a router to get online , do basic networking and play mafiawars and browse myspace all day , this router is great for you .
POSITIVE:1 OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average. 
POSITIVE:3 The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
NEGATIVE:-1 If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..
NEGATIVE:-2 I tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement.
NEGATIVE:-1 the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too . 
POSITIVE:2 Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket. 
POSITIVE:1  Then I would say that this LCD monitor have many feature in one piece .
NEGATIVE:-1 After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). 
POSITIVE:2   The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.  
POSITIVE:1 Enjoy.
POSITIVE:3 i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since . 
POSITIVE:1  This router is phenomenal !
NEGATIVE:-2 the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . 
NEGATIVE:-2 While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). 
POSITIVE:2 This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
NEGATIVE:-1  I guess that `` limited lifetime warranty '' means it may take a lifetime to collect on the warranty .
NEGATIVE:-2 The flaw is inside the Zen. 
POSITIVE:2 the movie mode is also working great . 
POSITIVE:3 It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc). 
POSITIVE:1  I really love this netbook .
POSITIVE:2 The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
NEGATIVE:-3 However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS. 
POSITIVE:2 it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes . 
POSITIVE:3 recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
POSITIVE:3 the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered . 
NEGATIVE:-3 A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it. 
POSITIVE:2 It works easily with one hand, which is important.
POSITIVE:3 Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
NEGATIVE:-1 even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . 
POSITIVE:1 sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod . 
NEGATIVE:-1 i am bored with the silver look . 
NEGATIVE:-3 the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use . 
POSITIVE:2 Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go. 
POSITIVE:2 good quality video . 
POSITIVE:2 Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility. 
NEGATIVE:-1 The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.
NEGATIVE:-2 the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call . 
NEGATIVE:-2 8mb for a camera like this is a joke . 
POSITIVE:1  It was nice to have the faster internal network speeds while we tested this router -LRB- which was for all of about 3 hours while trying to get everything to work properly -RRB- .
POSITIVE:2 i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box . 
POSITIVE:1  Best HT upgrade I 've made in over 2 years .
POSITIVE:2 5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . 
POSITIVE:1  This time , D-Link support was more helpful and guided me to the actual problem , which was that the router failed to `` auto-negotiate '' the Ethernet link speed from my FiOS optical network block .
NEGATIVE:-3  As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears. 
POSITIVE:3 what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal . 
POSITIVE:1  This is a great 3-piece speaker system for a computer , and it 's worth every penny .
POSITIVE:3 battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . 
NEGATIVE:-2 now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk . 
POSITIVE:3 All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment. 
NEGATIVE:-2 it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . 
POSITIVE:2 Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.
POSITIVE:3 the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I only give it 4 stars because the device came with really old dd-wrt software .
POSITIVE:2 It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
NEGATIVE:-3 I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
NEGATIVE:-2 the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest . 
POSITIVE:1 . iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod. 
POSITIVE:1  I just set it up manually , which is very easy .
POSITIVE:2 This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
POSITIVE:3 Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch. 
POSITIVE:4 The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
POSITIVE:3 while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it . 
NEGATIVE:-2  The first set I received had a loud audible tone coming from the speakers and had to be returned .
POSITIVE:2 because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's . 
POSITIVE:1  The colors and everything are great .
POSITIVE:2 The battery has a long life. 
NEGATIVE:-1  I usually avoid horns but I do n't hear anything overly extreme .
POSITIVE:1 So far I have no complaints with this player. 
POSITIVE:2 But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
POSITIVE:2 Speed is not a problem.      
NEGATIVE:-1 I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
POSITIVE:2 In my table the M12V has been a real champ.
POSITIVE:2 I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions. 
POSITIVE:2 What an upgrade!!!
POSITIVE:4 try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface . 
POSITIVE:3 Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.  
POSITIVE:2 audio is excellent . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) . 
POSITIVE:2 also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player . 
NEGATIVE:-2 We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
POSITIVE:1  So besides the annoyances , this is a fine speaker for the amount I paid .
NEGATIVE:-2 one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . 
POSITIVE:5 This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
POSITIVE:1  They sound wonderful the only issue is where to put them when I move around .
POSITIVE:3 6600 looks and feels nice.
NEGATIVE:-1 I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.
NEGATIVE:-1  I spent 4 hours on that and I could n't connect to the internet .
NEGATIVE:-2  Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT. 
POSITIVE:4 The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid. 
NEGATIVE:-1  3 - Not perfect quality of picture if you use the VGA Connection while the DVI Connection is perfect .
POSITIVE:1 I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face. 
POSITIVE:2 the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance . 
POSITIVE:4 seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) . 
POSITIVE:3 Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
POSITIVE:2 the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player . 
POSITIVE:1  The color is red and is so attractive !!
NEGATIVE:-1 regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
POSITIVE:2 I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
POSITIVE:2 first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint . 
POSITIVE:1  Nice and compact .
NEGATIVE:-3 They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
POSITIVE:1 * removable battery 
NEGATIVE:-3 I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
NEGATIVE:-2 in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) . 
POSITIVE:2 the storage capacity is great . 
NEGATIVE:-2 well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze . 
POSITIVE:3 the rate plans are also very good , at least for me . 
POSITIVE:3 it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there . 
POSITIVE:2 the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport . 
POSITIVE:2 This model appears to be especially good.  
POSITIVE:7 lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy . 
POSITIVE:4 I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card). 
NEGATIVE:-2 the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day . 
NEGATIVE:-2 It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
POSITIVE:3 I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy. 
POSITIVE:1  The final insult is that while this router comes with useful software to make sharing printers wirelessly a snap , it 's only a trial version -- you have to download the trial software from the internet then pay an additional $ 40-60 to some unknown company to unlock all the features !
POSITIVE:3 having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . 
NEGATIVE:-3 as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek. 
NEGATIVE:-2 i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective . 
NEGATIVE:-2 - the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch . 
POSITIVE:2 The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality. 
NEGATIVE:-2 it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . 
POSITIVE:3 It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.
POSITIVE:3 The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. 
POSITIVE:2 It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.   
NEGATIVE:-1  I unplugged it , plugged it back in , and the power supply failed .
POSITIVE:2 Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
POSITIVE:2 I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
NEGATIVE:-2 the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case . 
POSITIVE:2 3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
POSITIVE:3 Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .
POSITIVE:2  Color and contrast are perfect for my needs .
POSITIVE:3 i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
POSITIVE:6 The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. 
POSITIVE:1  I verified the signal strengths with a laptop and there was no problem there .
NEGATIVE:-1 navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . 
POSITIVE:1 sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Simply this product was created and was left behind !
POSITIVE:3 Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.
POSITIVE:2  This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now. 
POSITIVE:2 - light , compact design 
POSITIVE:3 You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable. 
POSITIVE:2 The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). 
POSITIVE:2   Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.  
POSITIVE:1  The range seems quite good even through walls .
POSITIVE:1  Definitely more capable of filling the room with sound than any other computer speakers I 've owned .
POSITIVE:1  : P Fantastic little computer , does everything I had hoped for work\/study\/travel .
NEGATIVE:-4 - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it . 
POSITIVE:1  As a Non-Technical person , I was surprised to install the Cisco Valet Plus Wireless Hotspot in less than 10 minutes .
POSITIVE:2 unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition . 
NEGATIVE:-2 * eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files . 
POSITIVE:1  I absolutely LOVE these speakers .
POSITIVE:1 retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display . 
POSITIVE:3 the battery life on this phone is surreal . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The router does n't support port translation , e.g forward port 8080 in the outside to port 80 in the inside .
POSITIVE:5 this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has . 
NEGATIVE:-4 unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . 
POSITIVE:4 ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good . 
POSITIVE:2 picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm . 
POSITIVE:2 I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
NEGATIVE:-2 The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.  
POSITIVE:2 first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good . 
NEGATIVE:-2 b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . 
POSITIVE:1  - Sub woofer is large .
POSITIVE:2 the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 
POSITIVE:2 The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.     
POSITIVE:2 And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
NEGATIVE:-3 after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
NEGATIVE:-1 nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now . 
POSITIVE:2 My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp. 
NEGATIVE:-2 weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . 
POSITIVE:1  When I put it to use for my daughter 's graduation party in longer lengths , the speaker wire worked as expected , even out of doors .
POSITIVE:2 the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers . 
POSITIVE:3 extremely convenient . 
POSITIVE:1  The price is very good .
NEGATIVE:-1  When the SecureSpot free trial finishes , they ask you to buy it and when you do n't , it stops working well .
NEGATIVE:-3 i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) . 
POSITIVE:2 But, for the money it is a good machine.
POSITIVE:2 I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money. 
POSITIVE:3 It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
POSITIVE:3 I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
POSITIVE:2 it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . 
NEGATIVE:-6 customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them . 
POSITIVE:4 otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue . 
POSITIVE:1 The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
POSITIVE:1 Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable! 
NEGATIVE:-2 I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
POSITIVE:4 Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
POSITIVE:3 Battery : A Big Big plus. 
POSITIVE:1  Very good value for the money .
POSITIVE:1 what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . 
NEGATIVE:-2 within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob . 
NEGATIVE:-2 on my main computer the software did not work right . 
POSITIVE:6 It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
NEGATIVE:-3 i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The sound quality is very poor .
POSITIVE:3 I love this product!
NEGATIVE:-1 Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
POSITIVE:1 there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful . 
POSITIVE:2 even viewed cds full of jpgs . 
POSITIVE:3 the features are really cool like the radio . 
POSITIVE:1 it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar . 
POSITIVE:2 canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . 
POSITIVE:2 excellent range of metering options as well . 
POSITIVE:1  Clear and crispy image .
NEGATIVE:-3 . lens cap is a really annoying 
POSITIVE:2 I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
NEGATIVE:-3 the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
POSITIVE:8 Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs. 
NEGATIVE:-2 It is not reliable.  
POSITIVE:1  They sound wonderful , in my opinion , and I have n't even touched any equalizers .
POSITIVE:6  The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
NEGATIVE:-2 creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked . 
POSITIVE:8 it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs . 
POSITIVE:2 The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
POSITIVE:6  FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
NEGATIVE:-2 unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . " 
NEGATIVE:-3 I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
POSITIVE:3 Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
NEGATIVE:-3 And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
POSITIVE:2 i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too . 
POSITIVE:3 it is crystal clear . 
NEGATIVE:-1  It 's a fun little gadget , do n't expect high definition sound .
POSITIVE:2  These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.
POSITIVE:3 While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player. 
POSITIVE:1 the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad . 
POSITIVE:2 While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
POSITIVE:1  Looks great .
NEGATIVE:-2 the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . 
POSITIVE:1  From the Belkin my reception increased over 25 % .
NEGATIVE:-2 one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 . 
POSITIVE:2 All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD. 
POSITIVE:1 Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
POSITIVE:2 And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
POSITIVE:3 overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . 
POSITIVE:2 It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.  
NEGATIVE:-1 The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  
NEGATIVE:-1 I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.
NEGATIVE:-2 every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes . 
POSITIVE:6 yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range . 
POSITIVE:4 speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
POSITIVE:3 sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod . 
POSITIVE:6 The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
NEGATIVE:-2 my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them . 
NEGATIVE:-2 5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! 
POSITIVE:2 I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date. 
POSITIVE:2 im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! 
POSITIVE:3 As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
POSITIVE:2 the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.     
NEGATIVE:-2 mediasource did not recognize my tags ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life . 
POSITIVE:2 i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive . 
POSITIVE:2 Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too.
NEGATIVE:-2 I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.   
NEGATIVE:-3 It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
POSITIVE:3  Bottom line is for the price , these things sound GREAT and have tons of good bass .
POSITIVE:5 t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?      
NEGATIVE:-2 scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I gave up after several attempts to contact dlink support .
POSITIVE:1  Worked fine after that .
POSITIVE:2 best in class. 
NEGATIVE:-2 When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
NEGATIVE:-1 The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
NEGATIVE:-1 5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing . 
POSITIVE:3 All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
NEGATIVE:-1 the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again . 
POSITIVE:3 The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
POSITIVE:1  This netbook is exactly what I want for my kids .
POSITIVE:1  Even better , you do n't have to worry about constantly replacing batteries .
NEGATIVE:-2 The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
POSITIVE:1 if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs . 
POSITIVE:1 i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor . 
POSITIVE:3 You willdefinitly appreciate the small size.
NEGATIVE:-3 The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
POSITIVE:1  I think the real reason that made the changes is that it now uses GPU hardware acceleration .
POSITIVE:2  In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
NEGATIVE:-1 The Battery does not last 12 hours.  
POSITIVE:6 It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  
NEGATIVE:-2 Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
POSITIVE:1 Record memos using the built in microphone.  
POSITIVE:1  It 's loud and the quality is good .
POSITIVE:1  I 'm delighted with this product .
POSITIVE:6 my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared . 
POSITIVE:3 it is lightweight , sleek and attractive . 
NEGATIVE:-3 the grain was terrible . 
NEGATIVE:-2 After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings. 
NEGATIVE:-2 the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button . 
POSITIVE:2  This router works very well right out of the box .
NEGATIVE:-1 All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
NEGATIVE:-1 The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
NEGATIVE:-3 after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift . 
POSITIVE:1  - Sound quality is good .
POSITIVE:3 possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery . 
POSITIVE:2 It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. 
POSITIVE:2 We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
POSITIVE:1 Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.  
POSITIVE:1  I get complete coverage everywhere in my house -LRB- about 3500 sq ft -RRB- and it 's located in the corner of my basement .
POSITIVE:1 It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.  
NEGATIVE:-1 But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.
POSITIVE:3 They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
POSITIVE:2 noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah . 
POSITIVE:1  In addition , it comes with a remote control .
POSITIVE:5 It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. 
POSITIVE:1  When I then moved the wire to the desktop and used the laptop wirelessly , the internet connection was just fine .
POSITIVE:1  I have this monitor for a month now and I 'm very pleased with it .
POSITIVE:2 so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost . 
POSITIVE:7 but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The only problem is the size of the keys.
NEGATIVE:-1 I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
POSITIVE:3 The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
POSITIVE:3 the g3 looks like a work of art ! 
POSITIVE:3 in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
POSITIVE:2 good looks 
NEGATIVE:-2 We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
POSITIVE:6 The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface. 
POSITIVE:5 sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored . 
NEGATIVE:-2 However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
POSITIVE:3 Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
NEGATIVE:-5 it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
NEGATIVE:-1  One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
POSITIVE:3 However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.   
POSITIVE:1 Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight. 
POSITIVE:1  I am a novice at this stuff but it was extremely easy to set the router up .
NEGATIVE:-2 however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.          
NEGATIVE:-2 bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. . 
POSITIVE:3 The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
POSITIVE:1 with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; 
NEGATIVE:-1 - no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking 
POSITIVE:2 Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen. 
POSITIVE:4  Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .
NEGATIVE:-1 yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . 
POSITIVE:2  Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.  
POSITIVE:2 transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy . 
POSITIVE:2 It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested. 
POSITIVE:2 this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve . 
POSITIVE:4  The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .
POSITIVE:3 can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go . 
NEGATIVE:-1 only if we could get one camera in it . . 
POSITIVE:4 Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
NEGATIVE:-1  I wanted the product to work soo bad , but it just did n't .
POSITIVE:2  Excellent heavy build quality , and the stands are not imposing and blend fairly well into the rest of my furniture .
POSITIVE:2  The screen quality is very high & the side view is very sharp & clear .
NEGATIVE:-1 sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much . 
NEGATIVE:-2 There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
POSITIVE:2 the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones . 
POSITIVE:3 it 's a very intuitive program . 
POSITIVE:5 This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot. 
POSITIVE:1  The build quality is top notch .
NEGATIVE:-3 It would not hang up on calls.
NEGATIVE:-1  The Klipsh subwoofer is laughable .
POSITIVE:1 Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
POSITIVE:3 but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
POSITIVE:2 Its compact and has rounded edges. 
NEGATIVE:-2 Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
POSITIVE:2 I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
POSITIVE:2 we are overall pleased with product . 
POSITIVE:3 The accesories that come with the player are great. 
POSITIVE:3 i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera . 
POSITIVE:1  This is the best speaker mount I had so far .
NEGATIVE:-1  I wished that they could make the volumn a little bit louder .
POSITIVE:3 i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
POSITIVE:1 it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
NEGATIVE:-2 audio on video also lacking . 
POSITIVE:3 Also, multiple picture feature is very, very fast.
NEGATIVE:-2 2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax . 
NEGATIVE:-2  I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .
NEGATIVE:-1 the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . 
POSITIVE:3 even did while daughter sleep and no noise!
POSITIVE:6  Pros : Low weight , long battery life , decent keyboard , decent screen , does not heat up , HDMI output , flawless local HD decoding Con : low audio volume , just enough CPU power
POSITIVE:3 The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
POSITIVE:2 they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.  
POSITIVE:2 Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
NEGATIVE:-1  I was looking forward to it even if all the other reviews already said it was slow .
NEGATIVE:-5 Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
NEGATIVE:-1 I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
POSITIVE:3 It's also easy to empty out.
NEGATIVE:-4 ( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable . 
POSITIVE:3 Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
NEGATIVE:-1  While upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke .
POSITIVE:2 all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) . 
POSITIVE:2 the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files . 
POSITIVE:3 Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!
NEGATIVE:-2 HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup. 
NEGATIVE:-2  One thing to consider is that these stands are not height adjustable and the speakers will not angle down .
POSITIVE:3 i love this player . 
NEGATIVE:-1  They caused the problem , ie wrong product in the box , the service tech failed to believe what the software said was wrong .
NEGATIVE:-4 a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid . 
NEGATIVE:-2 one still works fine , the other quit after one day . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. 
POSITIVE:3 overall it is the best camera on the market . 
POSITIVE:3 but canon never fails to amaze . 
POSITIVE:2 You just can't go wrong with this one!
POSITIVE:1  This system is very powerful .
POSITIVE:1 This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
POSITIVE:3 Works great!!!!
POSITIVE:2 I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
NEGATIVE:-1 1 ) a spare battery would have been great . 
POSITIVE:1  You ca n't go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package !
POSITIVE:1 Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.  
POSITIVE:2 However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.  
POSITIVE:2 Hate to wait between shots
NEGATIVE:-1 I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites. 
NEGATIVE:-2 my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The main problems for me is that the dsub cord from the sub to the control station is too short .
NEGATIVE:-3  CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier. 
NEGATIVE:-4 at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well . 
POSITIVE:3 the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds . 
POSITIVE:2 It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys. 
NEGATIVE:-1  I am disappointed in this product .
POSITIVE:1  Most products will last if taken care of , and Logitech 's products are no exception to this rule , however , since they are somewhat , in fact a great deal more sturdy , than my old radio .
POSITIVE:5 bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
NEGATIVE:-3 But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything. 
NEGATIVE:-5 Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
POSITIVE:3 In addition it is very easy to setup.  
NEGATIVE:-2 software downloads on the site crashed my pc . 
POSITIVE:6   Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
POSITIVE:2 I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  
POSITIVE:2 downloads are a snap and quick . 
POSITIVE:2  Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .
POSITIVE:7 This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.  
POSITIVE:2 with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it . 
NEGATIVE:-6 The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. 
POSITIVE:2 advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 
POSITIVE:3 Capacity is not a problem here.
POSITIVE:6 +Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right? 
POSITIVE:3 I just upgraded to the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G router last month and I am very happy with the quality of the product.  
NEGATIVE:-1  When I bought the third one , I thought I can give D-link one more try , but now I regret my decision .
POSITIVE:1  This is a plus with this netbook , the increased size of 1.6 inches means better and clear view of webpages and woks made in Office .
POSITIVE:3 i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! 
POSITIVE:2 the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy . 
POSITIVE:4 when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light . 
POSITIVE:3 i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it . 
POSITIVE:2  My house is small , so it 's hard to judge the real strenght of the product through a lot of walls , but in my house the product worked perfectly in all rooms and corners , with no signal interruptions .
NEGATIVE:-1 2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations . 
NEGATIVE:-3 it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
POSITIVE:1  If you are concerned about looks , get these .
POSITIVE:3 its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen . 
POSITIVE:2 This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.
POSITIVE:2 way less expensive than the ipod . 
POSITIVE:3 in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset . 
POSITIVE:2 We were able to obtain a Norton Corporate Edition of Antivirus only (no firewall or utilities) and so far it's great.
NEGATIVE:-2 the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd . 
POSITIVE:2 The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
POSITIVE:1  Worked fine .
POSITIVE:2 zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod . 
POSITIVE:1  I am very happy with this monitor .
NEGATIVE:-3  Hopless product , Hopeless Company and Hopeless Customer Support .
POSITIVE:3 this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong . 
POSITIVE:2 my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! 
POSITIVE:3 nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price . 
POSITIVE:3 This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.
POSITIVE:3 I highly recommend this phone.
POSITIVE:2 I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
NEGATIVE:-1 Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
NEGATIVE:-4 the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! 
POSITIVE:3 over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either ! 
POSITIVE:2  it 's far from expensive for the specifications but there is a lot more than in there ... i like it so much ... its nicely designed for the portable user and I like the Ferrari design on it .
NEGATIVE:-3  There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
POSITIVE:2 It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
POSITIVE:3 I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
NEGATIVE:-1 It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
NEGATIVE:-2 the included memory card is too small . 
POSITIVE:2  I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
POSITIVE:3 and so far , i 've been very pleased . 
POSITIVE:2 I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous. 
NEGATIVE:-1 The price is $... more.
POSITIVE:2 mixed bag i guess but the price was right . 
POSITIVE:1 2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . 
POSITIVE:3 the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior . 
NEGATIVE:-2 - The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. - ##Several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i'm starting to see why. 
POSITIVE:4 still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! 
POSITIVE:2 I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality. 
POSITIVE:2 - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price 
POSITIVE:1  Overall , it is an impressive display .
NEGATIVE:-3 However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
POSITIVE:5 I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!
POSITIVE:3 i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it . 
POSITIVE:3 the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so . 
NEGATIVE:-3 There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners. 
POSITIVE:3 For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.
POSITIVE:1  It works fine without the dock , but it 's shaky and unstable .
NEGATIVE:-2  Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
NEGATIVE:-3 I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
NEGATIVE:-1 Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.  
NEGATIVE:-1 i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . 
POSITIVE:2 But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
POSITIVE:2 3 ) user replaceable battery 
NEGATIVE:-2 I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
POSITIVE:2  It has good color and price was great .
POSITIVE:1  Easy to pair !
POSITIVE:2 + i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit 
POSITIVE:1 Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket. 
POSITIVE:2 getting files onto it is quick and painless . 
POSITIVE:2 i like the automatic key lock function . 
POSITIVE:2 Overall it is a great value.
NEGATIVE:-3 Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.
POSITIVE:1 the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative . 
POSITIVE:4 the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera . 
POSITIVE:4 the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality . 
POSITIVE:2 - excellent sound quality 
NEGATIVE:-2 the volume level of the phone is not all that good . 
POSITIVE:1 you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally! 
POSITIVE:2 The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
POSITIVE:3 the player 's software is very easy to use and very good . 
POSITIVE:2 I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it. 
NEGATIVE:-3 I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.     
NEGATIVE:-1  When I reset it , like unplugging it and plugging it back in , I would get the N speeds 150 mbps the first time it connected and would transfer files at that speed , then usually next time I connected it would drop back to 65 or 52 mbps and stay at these speeds .
NEGATIVE:-2 i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
POSITIVE:3 Diaper Champ is great.
NEGATIVE:-2 the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
POSITIVE:2 the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line . 
POSITIVE:2 8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . 
POSITIVE:2 For more than a year, and it is totally reliable.  
POSITIVE:3 The setup was very easy. 
POSITIVE:1  Absolutely love it and cant beat the price !
POSITIVE:3 Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  
POSITIVE:3 on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life . 
POSITIVE:4 the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution . 
POSITIVE:4 i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.  
POSITIVE:3 THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
NEGATIVE:-2 2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select . 
POSITIVE:1 sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features . 
POSITIVE:1 Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright. 
NEGATIVE:-2 I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. 
POSITIVE:1 I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
POSITIVE:1  Sound effects really sound more authentic .
POSITIVE:2 I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
NEGATIVE:-3 i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work ! 
POSITIVE:4 When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.
POSITIVE:2 Other than that, I love this camera.
POSITIVE:3  The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .
POSITIVE:3 This is one of the best purchases we made.
POSITIVE:4 the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . 
NEGATIVE:-2 That is, you cannot access the internet at all.  
POSITIVE:3 5- Excelent software package.
NEGATIVE:-2 Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
POSITIVE:2 On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.  
POSITIVE:3 all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.
POSITIVE:1  I would n't mind having an external adjustable antenna , but it does fine as is and the speed on the bottom floor of the house is much improved .
NEGATIVE:-1 Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac. 
POSITIVE:2 2 ) storage capacity 
POSITIVE:2 From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
NEGATIVE:-1 I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
NEGATIVE:-3 * software is absolutely terrible : 
NEGATIVE:-3 After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
POSITIVE:2 It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
POSITIVE:1  The software on the router is pretty good .
POSITIVE:1  The set-up went fairly smooth with netgears online knowledge base .
POSITIVE:3 Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
NEGATIVE:-2 and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title .. 
POSITIVE:2  Sound quality and base is amazing .
POSITIVE:3 This one is really great.
POSITIVE:2 2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use . 
POSITIVE:2 m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! 
POSITIVE:3 And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow. 
POSITIVE:1 it does well in all aspects of internet browsing . 
POSITIVE:7 Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  
POSITIVE:4 Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
NEGATIVE:-8 seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " . 
POSITIVE:3 Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it. 
POSITIVE:1  For the cost of this product i could not ask for more .
POSITIVE:6 The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
NEGATIVE:-3 I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
NEGATIVE:-2 Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
NEGATIVE:-3 overall , a very disappointing product . 
NEGATIVE:-2 however , it has failed to deliver on quality . 
POSITIVE:3  They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
POSITIVE:3  excellent , very good monitor to rest the price is pretty good , I recommendt he picture is sharp and in perfect condition came to Venezuela
NEGATIVE:-1 es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  
POSITIVE:2 However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior. 
NEGATIVE:-1  Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .
POSITIVE:1  The woofer is much larger .
POSITIVE:6 About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.  
POSITIVE:1 The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. 
NEGATIVE:-1  It will only move the monitor side to side -LRB- no up\/down or tilt feature -RRB- .
POSITIVE:1 Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
POSITIVE:2 The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
POSITIVE:1  The sound was crisp , clear , and no distortion .
POSITIVE:3 Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly.
POSITIVE:2 by the way , it looks nice also . 
NEGATIVE:-3 if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
POSITIVE:2 i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it . 
POSITIVE:1  It came back working , and I was momentarily glad that the rumors I 'd heard about Acer tech support did n't turn out to be true in my case .
POSITIVE:2  Otherwise a very decent monitor for its price .
POSITIVE:2 update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! 
POSITIVE:2 4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 
NEGATIVE:-3 When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
POSITIVE:1  I have used this monitor for a few months and have had no problems .
POSITIVE:6 the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent . 
POSITIVE:2 without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
POSITIVE:2 it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
NEGATIVE:-3 will never purchase apex again . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . 
POSITIVE:1 It also works just fine for international calls.
NEGATIVE:-4 its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . 
POSITIVE:3 (every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.
POSITIVE:2 there are a lot of things i like about it . 
NEGATIVE:-1 It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
POSITIVE:1 they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department . 
POSITIVE:2 The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.  
NEGATIVE:-3 i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
NEGATIVE:-2 7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 
NEGATIVE:-4 the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Called their support , they did n't have a clue so I returned it and I am looking for something else that will give me 150 mbps .
NEGATIVE:-1  So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.  
POSITIVE:1  I would strongly recommend this product !
POSITIVE:2 7 picture quality is excellent . 
POSITIVE:2 But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
POSITIVE:1  I was surprised how good the sound was and I especially like to use it when I am listening to audio books .
NEGATIVE:-4  No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
POSITIVE:3  This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .
POSITIVE:2 operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The internal network still functioned , but it would not pass through the internet signal from the cable modem .
NEGATIVE:-2 when talking the voice is not very clear . 
POSITIVE:6 I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.
POSITIVE:2 at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod . 
POSITIVE:3 The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
POSITIVE:1 The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
NEGATIVE:-1  I started accessing and transfering files to find it to be extremely SLOW .
NEGATIVE:-1 the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
