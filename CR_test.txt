POSITIVE:3 otherwise , this player is awesome ! 
POSITIVE:2 I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
POSITIVE:3 *holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
POSITIVE:6 i am very pleased with its quality and durability . 
POSITIVE:3 I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.
NEGATIVE:-2 In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
NEGATIVE:-1  The problems came from my video card .
NEGATIVE:-3 Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
POSITIVE:2 This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.  
NEGATIVE:-2 - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage . 
POSITIVE:2  Assembly of the stands is very straightforward , and well detailed in the instructions .
POSITIVE:1 has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . 
POSITIVE:1 The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    
POSITIVE:2 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . 
POSITIVE:4 Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.
NEGATIVE:-2 they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) . 
POSITIVE:3 MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
NEGATIVE:-1 Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
POSITIVE:3 The photo quality is amazing. 
POSITIVE:1 The included earphones are pretty good - my advice? 
NEGATIVE:-1 1) It is perhaps too small. 
NEGATIVE:-2 but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes . 
POSITIVE:1 Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.   
NEGATIVE:-1 It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.
NEGATIVE:-3 this thing is trash . 
POSITIVE:3 I still can't believe how fast it starts up. 
POSITIVE:3 This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
NEGATIVE:-2 the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . 
POSITIVE:1  Then I would say that this LCD monitor have many feature in one piece .
POSITIVE:3 All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.     
POSITIVE:1 if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
NEGATIVE:-3 Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
POSITIVE:3 Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room. 
NEGATIVE:-3 Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  charging[-2] ##Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.     
POSITIVE:2  I was looking for an inexpensive , room-suited ipod speaker and this is what I got .
NEGATIVE:-3 difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate . 
POSITIVE:3 i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had . 
POSITIVE:2  Good range & speed .
POSITIVE:2 connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! 
POSITIVE:5 And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
NEGATIVE:-2  I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .
NEGATIVE:-2 they are not wowable good . 
NEGATIVE:-3 . lens cap is a really annoying 
POSITIVE:1  This product is definitely worth the purchase .
POSITIVE:2 It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. 
POSITIVE:1  I thot my original monitor had a good image , but the S201HL has a much brighter display .
NEGATIVE:-2 But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.
POSITIVE:1 it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar . 
NEGATIVE:-1  -LRB- lost internet connection with the router , internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem -RRB- .
POSITIVE:2 the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . 
POSITIVE:1  I 'm delighted with this product .
POSITIVE:1  The sound became instantly clear again .
NEGATIVE:-2 within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob . 
POSITIVE:4 the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I do n't think the external switch is much of a feature because in the end , you have to learn how to identify IP addresses , switch the router from from a dynamic to static IP address , and assign a static IP address that is compatible with your router or modem .
POSITIVE:4 But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.
POSITIVE:6 Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
POSITIVE:2  Overall they are great stands and look good .
NEGATIVE:-2 4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
POSITIVE:1 The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. 
POSITIVE:3 its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus. 
POSITIVE:2 I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
POSITIVE:2 The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  
POSITIVE:1  The second set is working just fine .
NEGATIVE:-2 nothing but hassle with this company . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
POSITIVE:2 Picture and video quality is ok.
NEGATIVE:-2 the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
POSITIVE:2 i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money . 
POSITIVE:3 Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly. 
POSITIVE:2 I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
NEGATIVE:-3 3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
POSITIVE:3 Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
POSITIVE:4 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 
POSITIVE:3 Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
POSITIVE:4 If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.             
NEGATIVE:-2 However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
NEGATIVE:-5 short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .
NEGATIVE:-1 The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
NEGATIVE:-2 7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. 
NEGATIVE:-3 the software failed repeatedly . 
POSITIVE:2 i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement . 
POSITIVE:2 I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
POSITIVE:1 I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.  
POSITIVE:3 What impressed me most was the sound.  
POSITIVE:3 i am very pleased so far . 
POSITIVE:2 The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
NEGATIVE:-3 as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale . 
POSITIVE:2 I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great. 
NEGATIVE:-1 I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
POSITIVE:3 The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
POSITIVE:2 I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
POSITIVE:2 As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen. 
NEGATIVE:-1  The range of response seems a little limited to me -LRB- changing the EQ setting on the iPod produces a definite change in the sound , but I would expect a little more richness in the changes -RRB- .
POSITIVE:1 the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit : 
POSITIVE:1 it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something . 
POSITIVE:3  The speakers perform very well , and with the bass boost , the sound fills outs exceedingly well .
POSITIVE:1  The set up for this product was a breeze .
POSITIVE:2 i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . 
POSITIVE:2 The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
POSITIVE:1  I have this monitor for a month now and I 'm very pleased with it .
NEGATIVE:-3 I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.   
NEGATIVE:-1 where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  
NEGATIVE:-1  If you are not picky about image quality , go for it .
POSITIVE:2 It works with a minimum of fuss.
NEGATIVE:-1 you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
POSITIVE:5 it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
NEGATIVE:-1  If you want good sound , STAY AWAY !!!
POSITIVE:3 I think it's great.
POSITIVE:2 replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 . 
POSITIVE:1 We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).
NEGATIVE:-3 the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . ) 
POSITIVE:3 This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
POSITIVE:2 I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
POSITIVE:3 get it , it 's woth every penny ! ! 
POSITIVE:3 the lcd screen was very large and readable . 
POSITIVE:2 This is also the case with NIS 2004.
POSITIVE:2 This one has a good looking.
POSITIVE:4 speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
NEGATIVE:-2 we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use . 
NEGATIVE:-3 but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
NEGATIVE:-2 player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 . 
POSITIVE:3 I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
NEGATIVE:-2 My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
NEGATIVE:-1 The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.  
POSITIVE:3 This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
POSITIVE:3 when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . 
POSITIVE:7 this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images . 
NEGATIVE:-5 After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. 
POSITIVE:2  I mainly use it with my Apple IPad and it really sounds quite good for it diminutive size .
POSITIVE:5 not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy . 
NEGATIVE:-2 one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . 
NEGATIVE:-1 They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  
POSITIVE:10 It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
POSITIVE:2 i treat the battery well and it has lasted . 
POSITIVE:8 It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
POSITIVE:1 UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
NEGATIVE:-1 Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
POSITIVE:2  The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .
NEGATIVE:-1  The only negative thing about this was the instructions for adjusting the display were not very clear and it took a little time to figure out how to do it .
POSITIVE:3 Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  
NEGATIVE:-2 The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
NEGATIVE:-1 the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
NEGATIVE:-2 Radio Quality: weak reception     
NEGATIVE:-1  The router does n't support port translation , e.g forward port 8080 in the outside to port 80 in the inside .
NEGATIVE:-2 Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod. 
NEGATIVE:-1  Cons : - I think the satellites look ugly .
POSITIVE:1 Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.  
NEGATIVE:-2 Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100! 
POSITIVE:1  Good battery life !
POSITIVE:1  So far the router has worked well .
NEGATIVE:-2  Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .
POSITIVE:2 the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) . 
POSITIVE:4  Thats pretty much it , the speakers rock , the control station and remote are nifty , and the sub is powerful .
NEGATIVE:-2 My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
POSITIVE:2 overall i like it . 
POSITIVE:2 the battery is nice . 
POSITIVE:3 what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . 
POSITIVE:3 ) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. 
POSITIVE:2 I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
NEGATIVE:-2  The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .
POSITIVE:2 APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
NEGATIVE:-2 There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
NEGATIVE:-2 3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing . 
NEGATIVE:-3 well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) . 
NEGATIVE:-2 After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings. 
POSITIVE:2 despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
POSITIVE:4  Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable. 
POSITIVE:1  Pros : Competitive Cost Win 7 Home premium HDMI port -LRB- I could watch the Amazon instant videos on my HDTV and its delivering great .
NEGATIVE:-2 Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc. 
NEGATIVE:-2 the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have . 
POSITIVE:2 the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there . 
POSITIVE:1  We are well pleased with the monitor and the company .
POSITIVE:2 I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
POSITIVE:3 I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  
NEGATIVE:-1 The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
POSITIVE:6 awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
POSITIVE:1 easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
POSITIVE:9 The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
NEGATIVE:-2 STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.
POSITIVE:2 the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack . 
POSITIVE:2 ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier . 
POSITIVE:2 the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
NEGATIVE:-1 the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 
POSITIVE:1 All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one. 
POSITIVE:3 I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
NEGATIVE:-2 in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place . 
POSITIVE:2  The rechargeable battery is a great feature .
POSITIVE:2 I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
NEGATIVE:-4 There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.  
POSITIVE:2 Hate to wait between shots
NEGATIVE:-2 only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . 
POSITIVE:3 For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
POSITIVE:2 Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.  
POSITIVE:2 my first impression was positive . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
POSITIVE:3 * slick-looking design and improved interface 
POSITIVE:1  : P Fantastic little computer , does everything I had hoped for work\/study\/travel .
POSITIVE:2 I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
POSITIVE:3 There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.  
POSITIVE:2 overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically .
POSITIVE:3 All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
POSITIVE:2  Its tiny and has really decent sound for something so small .
POSITIVE:3 However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.   
POSITIVE:1  The sound is just fine. 
POSITIVE:6 Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
POSITIVE:2 i like the speakphone function a lot . 
POSITIVE:1  In addition the price point is spectacular .
NEGATIVE:-2 Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.  
NEGATIVE:-2 However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
POSITIVE:1 The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
POSITIVE:2 removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years . 
POSITIVE:3 extremely convenient . 
POSITIVE:4 nice little phone ... light compact . . 
POSITIVE:3 because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible . 
POSITIVE:3 the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . 
POSITIVE:2 no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers . 
NEGATIVE:-3 SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
NEGATIVE:-3 And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
NEGATIVE:-4 The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.   
NEGATIVE:-1 This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
POSITIVE:6 the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly . 
POSITIVE:2 I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.  
POSITIVE:2 Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
POSITIVE:2 A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
POSITIVE:1  When I put it to use for my daughter 's graduation party in longer lengths , the speaker wire worked as expected , even out of doors .
NEGATIVE:-2 We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
POSITIVE:1  I absolutely LOVE these speakers .
NEGATIVE:-2 No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
POSITIVE:1  Overall a sweet machine .
POSITIVE:3 as said before this works perfectly . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) . 
POSITIVE:3 Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
POSITIVE:2 This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
POSITIVE:3 i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome . 
NEGATIVE:-2 navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs . 
POSITIVE:2 they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
POSITIVE:1 nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something . 
POSITIVE:1  Very smooth .
NEGATIVE:-3 This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
POSITIVE:5 the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the remote is a little hard to understand . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
POSITIVE:2 ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all 
POSITIVE:2 i bought the player this week and i like it by far . 
POSITIVE:3 it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
POSITIVE:6 There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
NEGATIVE:-3 mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
NEGATIVE:-2 the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be . 
POSITIVE:3 I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
NEGATIVE:-2 in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . 
POSITIVE:2 This is really a no brainer. 
NEGATIVE:-1   And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.  
NEGATIVE:-4 the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with . 
POSITIVE:2 i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . 
NEGATIVE:-2 DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
NEGATIVE:-3 i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . 
POSITIVE:3 the features are really cool like the radio . 
POSITIVE:3 The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  
POSITIVE:3 2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.
POSITIVE:2 It's faster than WMP. 
POSITIVE:1 look at the size of it!
NEGATIVE:-3 third , the poor design continues with the case . 
POSITIVE:1  The sound quality is very exceptable .
POSITIVE:1 the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1 - no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking 
POSITIVE:1 i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
POSITIVE:2 the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had . 
NEGATIVE:-2 It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
POSITIVE:2 it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket . 
POSITIVE:2 another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world . 
POSITIVE:2 i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory . 
POSITIVE:3 the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
POSITIVE:2 This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  
NEGATIVE:-1 (...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging. 
POSITIVE:2 this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Unfortunately , the installation software crashed several times and I had to reboot my Vista PC at least twice -- not fun .
POSITIVE:1 I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
NEGATIVE:-2 Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.    
POSITIVE:3 I love this product!
NEGATIVE:-2 enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . 
POSITIVE:2 The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
POSITIVE:3 the other controls are all very easy to use . 
POSITIVE:3 this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 
POSITIVE:3 great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great. 
POSITIVE:1 i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Maybe some of you do n't have this problem , but I know of over 20 cases of buzzing from this monitor .
POSITIVE:1  Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge. 
NEGATIVE:-1  I unplugged it , plugged it back in , and the power supply failed .
NEGATIVE:-2 The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can. 
POSITIVE:5 Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. 
POSITIVE:3 sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best. 
POSITIVE:3 As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'. 
NEGATIVE:-2 the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . 
NEGATIVE:-3 as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand . 
POSITIVE:3 the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . 
NEGATIVE:-2 But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
POSITIVE:2 one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software . 
POSITIVE:2 The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent. 
POSITIVE:2 2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use . 
POSITIVE:3 i 'm really happy with this purchase . 
NEGATIVE:-2  I tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price .
NEGATIVE:-2 they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them . 
POSITIVE:2 so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine . 
POSITIVE:3 nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price . 
POSITIVE:2 still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! 
POSITIVE:3 Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
POSITIVE:2 But, for the money it is a good machine.
POSITIVE:1  - Sound quality is good .
POSITIVE:2 - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily . 
POSITIVE:5 It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.  
NEGATIVE:-4 Touch Pad: design could be better - Volume Control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick. 
POSITIVE:1 the price / performance looked just right . 
POSITIVE:1  You should use the firmware on the DD-WRT website instead .
POSITIVE:1  Setup was very easy .
POSITIVE:2 It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.   
POSITIVE:3 The log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways.
POSITIVE:4 it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video . 
POSITIVE:3 and really this is the best phone one could have . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it ! 
POSITIVE:3  I 'm glad I went with it , it actually exceeds my ViewSonic for color , brightness , and pixel quality .
POSITIVE:3 overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
NEGATIVE:-4 It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
POSITIVE:3 i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player . 
POSITIVE:3  The comparable product in quality is the old style Shelf Speaker popular in the 80 's , called the brick , but this unit does not have the weight of that product .
NEGATIVE:-3 I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
NEGATIVE:-1 it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack . 
NEGATIVE:-1  First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself. 
POSITIVE:2 The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
NEGATIVE:-2 it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
NEGATIVE:-1 But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.
POSITIVE:2 i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . 
POSITIVE:3 The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
POSITIVE:6 IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....     
POSITIVE:5 This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation. 
NEGATIVE:-2 deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). 
NEGATIVE:-2 It is not reliable.  
POSITIVE:1  The sound that came from that cheap little record player sounded like Carnegie Hall .
NEGATIVE:-2 5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! 
POSITIVE:1 If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
POSITIVE:3 This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
POSITIVE:3 unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.  
POSITIVE:2  Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
POSITIVE:3 The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
POSITIVE:4 I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. 
POSITIVE:3 An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. 
POSITIVE:2 it 's size also makes it ideal for travel . 
POSITIVE:2 Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
POSITIVE:2 one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting . 
POSITIVE:3 And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
POSITIVE:5 the phone is small , light , and very attractive . 
NEGATIVE:-3 You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.  
POSITIVE:2 the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool . 
POSITIVE:3 I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.     
POSITIVE:2 There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
POSITIVE:1 i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . 
POSITIVE:1 Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes. 
POSITIVE:6 but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad . 
POSITIVE:3  However , if speed , reliability , and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements , then this router will do the job .
NEGATIVE:-1 the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all . 
NEGATIVE:-2 fm receiver - it has none . 
POSITIVE:3 Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  
NEGATIVE:-4 I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
POSITIVE:3 i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera . 
NEGATIVE:-3 However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS. 
POSITIVE:2  These speakers have great sound but they will buzz if you leave them on with the sound turned up .
POSITIVE:2 it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones . 
POSITIVE:2 i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 
POSITIVE:2 they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
POSITIVE:2  With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch
NEGATIVE:-2 I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.     
NEGATIVE:-1  SETUP SOFTWARE - For my application , I found the setup software on the enclosed CD to be useless .
NEGATIVE:-1 Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco. 
POSITIVE:6 the reception and sound quality are top-notch . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 
POSITIVE:6 Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
NEGATIVE:-1  The interface took a little getting used to.
NEGATIVE:-2 also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate . 
POSITIVE:2 The Champ works great.
POSITIVE:2 The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.  
POSITIVE:2 Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
POSITIVE:5 I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!
POSITIVE:1  It allows the USB interface on the router to be used either for NAS or print server .
NEGATIVE:-1 The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".  
POSITIVE:2 b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive . 
POSITIVE:2  Has a great helpline.
POSITIVE:1 4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . 
POSITIVE:2 i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Display glitches and flashes also occurred .
POSITIVE:4 price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad . 
POSITIVE:1 third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
POSITIVE:2  My fiance ordered this computer , she 's a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her .
POSITIVE:2 also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . 
NEGATIVE:-2 You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
NEGATIVE:-2 The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac. 
POSITIVE:2 the storage capacity is great for me -- 
POSITIVE:3 this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . 
NEGATIVE:-2 also , the lens cap design is flawed . 
POSITIVE:3 Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm. 
NEGATIVE:-1 navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . 
POSITIVE:5 manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . 
NEGATIVE:-2 in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . 
NEGATIVE:-3 like other reviewers , installation was hell . 
POSITIVE:3 But the product iself is great.  
POSITIVE:2 it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
POSITIVE:1  My 2 XBoxs , Ipod , Iphone , Ipad are all catching a nice strong signal .
POSITIVE:3 Bottom line great phone for the time being.
POSITIVE:1  The woofer is much larger .
NEGATIVE:-1  I usually avoid horns but I do n't hear anything overly extreme .
NEGATIVE:-1 Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. 
POSITIVE:6 Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  
POSITIVE:2 first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective ) 
POSITIVE:2 The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.  
POSITIVE:2 this phone is highly recommended otherwise . 
POSITIVE:2 this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones . 
POSITIVE:2 I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
POSITIVE:3 Having the Digic II chip helps a lot. 
POSITIVE:2 For more than a year, and it is totally reliable.  
POSITIVE:1  Bass fanatics , look at the S120PII .
NEGATIVE:-6 then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . 
POSITIVE:1  I was a little skeptical because of how cheap it was .
NEGATIVE:-2 the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . 
POSITIVE:1 Cuts are easy and smooth.
NEGATIVE:-2 unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Still has terrible software.  
POSITIVE:1 i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
POSITIVE:2 The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
NEGATIVE:-2 There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
NEGATIVE:-2 after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available . 
POSITIVE:2 This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.        
NEGATIVE:-2 i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused . 
NEGATIVE:-3 However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
NEGATIVE:-7 when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door . 
POSITIVE:6 The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.  
POSITIVE:2 I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
POSITIVE:2 Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time. 
POSITIVE:4 The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. 
POSITIVE:2 I have the black one and adore it. 
NEGATIVE:-2 Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
NEGATIVE:-1 Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
POSITIVE:2 it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy . 
POSITIVE:6 Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.     
POSITIVE:3 I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice. 
POSITIVE:2 naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable . 
POSITIVE:2 The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info. 
POSITIVE:3 i highly recommend it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
POSITIVE:1  From the Belkin my reception increased over 25 % .
POSITIVE:3 have had the player since xmass and love it ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 this dvd play is basicly junk . 
NEGATIVE:-3 When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
NEGATIVE:-3 Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
NEGATIVE:-1 the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead . 
NEGATIVE:-1 As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance. 
NEGATIVE:-1  My only complaint , is that the cord is not long enough .
POSITIVE:2 2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.
POSITIVE:2 although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone . 
POSITIVE:3 + the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering . 
POSITIVE:1 All in all I am pleased with the router.
POSITIVE:2 User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward. 
NEGATIVE:-2 To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
POSITIVE:1 The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
POSITIVE:1  After much frustration , I finally upgraded the firmware to the latest DD-WRT firmware at DD-WRT 's website and it resolved all my problems .
NEGATIVE:-1 I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode). 
POSITIVE:2 We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
POSITIVE:1 In fact, it supports the new WPA encryption standard, which is WAY better than WEP.  
POSITIVE:2 the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it . 
POSITIVE:3  The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .
NEGATIVE:-3 i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . 
NEGATIVE:-2 We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
POSITIVE:2 i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all . 
POSITIVE:3 The sound is amazing. 
POSITIVE:3 I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
NEGATIVE:-3 The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  
NEGATIVE:-3 i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal . 
NEGATIVE:-1 however , the creative software is not real intuitive . 
POSITIVE:3 However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.  
POSITIVE:2 The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
NEGATIVE:-3 creative software stinks . 
NEGATIVE:-1 When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless. 
POSITIVE:2 Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
NEGATIVE:-3 the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least . 
POSITIVE:1  It was worth the wait because AG Neovo 's standout 17 '' monitor has all this and more .
NEGATIVE:-1 These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
NEGATIVE:-3 you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll . 
NEGATIVE:-7 kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that . 
POSITIVE:1 the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery . 
NEGATIVE:-1  This product did not work at all .
POSITIVE:1  I set it up in my living room and the sound was superb .
POSITIVE:2 the moveable lcd screen is great . 
POSITIVE:3 The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
NEGATIVE:-2 my only significant complaint is sound quality . 
NEGATIVE:-1 NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.  
NEGATIVE:-1  This router gets 1 star from me due to it 's disconnect issue .
POSITIVE:2 Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. 
NEGATIVE:-1 You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
NEGATIVE:-4 ( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! 
POSITIVE:6 longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities . 
POSITIVE:3 I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones. 
NEGATIVE:-1 The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
POSITIVE:2 newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
POSITIVE:2 without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen . 
NEGATIVE:-3 one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu . 
POSITIVE:2 the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice . 
POSITIVE:2  The USB port on the back is a nice feature .
POSITIVE:1 sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod . 
POSITIVE:2  Though it does n't have quite the screen real estate , it 's an excellent monitor and crystal clear at a resolution of 1920x1080 .
NEGATIVE:-1 whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side. 
POSITIVE:8 other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod . 
POSITIVE:1  THIS ROUTER IS AWESOM BUT IT WILL ONLY SUPPORT 1 XBOX WE HAVE 3 AND YOU CAN NEVER GET MORE THAN 1 TO HAVE A OPEN NAT TYPE THE OTHERS ARE USUALY MODERATE OR STRICT WHEN I CONTACED SUPPORT THEY WERE VERY NICE AND TRIED THRE BEST TO GET IT WORKING RIGHT BUT TO NO AVAIL BOTTOM LINE IF YOU JUST HAVE A COMPUTER A LAPTOP AND 1 360 YOU WILL BE FINE AND VERY SECURE THIS ROUTER IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY
NEGATIVE:-2 it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! ! 
POSITIVE:1  The range is GREAT - upstairs , downstairs , outside , or in a basement - four bars , all the time .
NEGATIVE:-3 very bad quality . 
POSITIVE:3 i love this player . 
POSITIVE:3 i love my new nomad , its great ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 
POSITIVE:3  The Acer Monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area -LRB- from a heighth perspective -RRB- that many 20 '' screens will not fit in .
NEGATIVE:-3 I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
POSITIVE:1  Set up WPA with no problems .
POSITIVE:1 retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display . 
POSITIVE:4  - Power , volume , and bass controls on the right speaker are fairly handy .
NEGATIVE:-1  My biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my 2nd generation iPod Nano .
POSITIVE:2 there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth. 
POSITIVE:6 All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
NEGATIVE:-2 1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . 
POSITIVE:1 t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's . 
POSITIVE:1  it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand .
POSITIVE:1  I was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup .
POSITIVE:2 yes , the features are numerous . 
POSITIVE:1  I really liked the size so I researched what to buy and this was it .
POSITIVE:3 I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
NEGATIVE:-1  I called the tech support and they helped me install new firmware , but this did not solve the problem .
NEGATIVE:-2 The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
POSITIVE:2  The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .
POSITIVE:2 it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep . 
POSITIVE:2 having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Now when the backlight fails , I have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day .
POSITIVE:2 There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router. 
POSITIVE:1 radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in . 
POSITIVE:2 the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted . 
POSITIVE:3 the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away . 
NEGATIVE:-1 -- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library . 
POSITIVE:1  For those who want the thump that this is capable of producing -LRB- very good for a computer speaker -RRB- , this is probably necessary .
POSITIVE:1  Tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone .
POSITIVE:3 It's so small. 
POSITIVE:3 the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I am disappointed in this product .
NEGATIVE:-2 The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
NEGATIVE:-1 Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
POSITIVE:1  Worked fine .
POSITIVE:3 but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there . 
POSITIVE:1  Sounds awesome .
POSITIVE:3  The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .
POSITIVE:3 it is crystal clear . 
POSITIVE:5 it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Booting up my computer took forever!!!
POSITIVE:2 + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Technical support rude and unhelpful .
POSITIVE:1  Reliable , Highly available and ease of administration and forget about me -LRB- Do n't bother anymore -RRB- equipment !
POSITIVE:2 i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime . 
POSITIVE:2  It was easy to install all of the components and directions were easy to understand , even for an old guy like me .
POSITIVE:1 As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.  
POSITIVE:3 This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
POSITIVE:3 i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 
NEGATIVE:-1 even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Easy enough but it did not work .
NEGATIVE:-5 This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
POSITIVE:4 recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately . 
NEGATIVE:-2 what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . 
POSITIVE:2 I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous. 
POSITIVE:1 digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
POSITIVE:2 Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
NEGATIVE:-1 The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
NEGATIVE:-1 my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor . 
POSITIVE:6 The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
NEGATIVE:-2 It still smelled.
POSITIVE:2  The full sized keyboard is sweet not to mention the aquamarine color .
POSITIVE:3 The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.  
POSITIVE:1  It came well-packaged .
POSITIVE:1 but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing . 
POSITIVE:2 Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours. 
POSITIVE:1 The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use. 
POSITIVE:1  Best HT upgrade I 've made in over 2 years .
POSITIVE:1 - the unit is easy to use and intuitive . 
POSITIVE:2 this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . 
POSITIVE:2 way less expensive than the ipod . 
POSITIVE:3 The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
NEGATIVE:-2  So slow , that it is not useable for files of any size or back-ups .
NEGATIVE:-2  Sometimes the system would hang , so I would have to restart the router , then get going again .
NEGATIVE:-2 the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . 
POSITIVE:1  The operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the Windows 7 Home Professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with Windows 7 Starter doesnt allow , and nobody mention this .
POSITIVE:3 I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
NEGATIVE:-1  While upgrading the memory the keyboard connector broke .
POSITIVE:3 This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
POSITIVE:1  I am in the business and have seen many 19 '' LCD monitors that sell for much , much more , and aside from monitors with a higher resolution -LRB- ie 1600 x 1200 -RRB- , there is no noticable difference at all .
NEGATIVE:-4 it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . 
NEGATIVE:-5 They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
NEGATIVE:-6 negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button . 
POSITIVE:2 + i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit 
POSITIVE:2 i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs . 
NEGATIVE:-2 it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time . 
POSITIVE:3 it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes . 
NEGATIVE:-1 one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . 
POSITIVE:3 There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
POSITIVE:3 you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
POSITIVE:1 and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 
POSITIVE:3 first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . 
POSITIVE:9 I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
NEGATIVE:-2 If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . 
POSITIVE:1 first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer . 
POSITIVE:1 It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.
POSITIVE:2 The battery is removable. 
POSITIVE:2 the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 
NEGATIVE:-6 The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
NEGATIVE:-1  Shareport is not compatible with Mac OS .
POSITIVE:2 What an upgrade!!!
NEGATIVE:-1 On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
POSITIVE:1  Battery last longer too .
POSITIVE:3 Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable. 
POSITIVE:1 this player seems to work fine with everything else . 
POSITIVE:6 +looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
NEGATIVE:-3 What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
NEGATIVE:-1  Brightness could be better and the viewing angle is not great , but for the price I paid for a 24inch monitor , this can not be beat .
NEGATIVE:-1  It 's a fun little gadget , do n't expect high definition sound .
POSITIVE:2 am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 It's too bad, though, that !
NEGATIVE:-1  Hooked up to the D-Link extreme N , connected speed dropped to 18mbps and wireless down to 8mbps .
NEGATIVE:-3  There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
NEGATIVE:-1  They do look cool in the dark though .
POSITIVE:2 the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
POSITIVE:2 I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.  
POSITIVE:2  I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
POSITIVE:1  If you are concerned about looks , get these .
POSITIVE:2 i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I gave up after several attempts to contact dlink support .
POSITIVE:1  Not a bad monitor for $ 120 but it 's nothing special .
POSITIVE:2 I am very pleased with my purchase.
POSITIVE:3 i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far . 
POSITIVE:1  I am above average with technical knowledge but it is easy enough for the beginner to set up .
POSITIVE:2 Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products. 
POSITIVE:2 It's good.
POSITIVE:3 Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
POSITIVE:1 - speakerphone 
POSITIVE:1 I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
NEGATIVE:-3 Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.
POSITIVE:3 The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
POSITIVE:4 touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct . 
POSITIVE:3 i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again . 
POSITIVE:1 The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  
POSITIVE:2 Overall it is a great value.
NEGATIVE:-3 When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
POSITIVE:3 The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
POSITIVE:2 i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful . 
NEGATIVE:-2 you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with. 
NEGATIVE:-2 Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.     
NEGATIVE:-2 the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective . 
NEGATIVE:-4 forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds. 
POSITIVE:5 Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.     
NEGATIVE:-1 Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
POSITIVE:3 The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
POSITIVE:2  I got this for use on my truck and I 'm happy with it for the most part , it is loud and super easy to install , however you are going to want an amp for i
NEGATIVE:-2 Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
NEGATIVE:-1 3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software . 
POSITIVE:2 when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off . 
POSITIVE:2 but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it . 
NEGATIVE:-6 I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
POSITIVE:2 All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD. 
POSITIVE:2 feels solid in hand . 
NEGATIVE:-3 In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
POSITIVE:1 Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!
POSITIVE:4 Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. 
POSITIVE:9 2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
NEGATIVE:-1  Bottom Line - Do n't buy this for the USB function .
POSITIVE:2 I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.  
NEGATIVE:-3 because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack. 
POSITIVE:2 So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html      
NEGATIVE:-1 No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
POSITIVE:1  The windows 7 premium is good -LRB- do n't recommend starter -RRB- and user friendly .
NEGATIVE:-1 my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go . 
POSITIVE:3 and we definitely prefer our Champ!
NEGATIVE:-2 The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
NEGATIVE:-1  One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
NEGATIVE:-1 The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
POSITIVE:2 Other than that, I love this camera.
NEGATIVE:-3 3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . 
POSITIVE:1  After seeing and hearing the sound of the I-Tour Pop speaker , I was sold .
NEGATIVE:-1 The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.
POSITIVE:2 overall this is the best phone i have ever owned . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy . 
POSITIVE:2 2 ) storage capacity 
POSITIVE:1  I am using JBL N38 II as surround left & right , which is again a very nice excellent speaker set .
POSITIVE:3 All the good reviews for the SD500 are true. 
POSITIVE:1 6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model . 
NEGATIVE:-2 After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). 
POSITIVE:1 So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality? size[+2]##because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
POSITIVE:2 overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it . 
POSITIVE:2 this thing plays everything i feed it . 
POSITIVE:1  So if you 're game for a little fiddling , you may be very pleased with this 5-day forecaster .
NEGATIVE:-3 However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
POSITIVE:2 i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work . 
POSITIVE:4 still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! 
POSITIVE:2 the service from t-mobile is very good too . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area. 
POSITIVE:3 fact is , it could n't be easier to use . 
POSITIVE:2 - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company . 
POSITIVE:3 Tough as nails. 
POSITIVE:2 The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   
POSITIVE:2 it works great . 
NEGATIVE:-1  They are a bit top heavy , as any tower will be .
POSITIVE:1  It also has excellent coverage through our two story house .
POSITIVE:4  The contrast , crispness , and readability from even the most extreme viewing angles ca n't be beat .
POSITIVE:6 The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. 
NEGATIVE:-3 imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex . 
POSITIVE:2 Works pretty well. 
POSITIVE:1  Looks great .
NEGATIVE:-1 The sliding latch is does not stay in place.
POSITIVE:2 i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  
POSITIVE:1  Great speakers overall .
POSITIVE:6 Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect. 
NEGATIVE:-3 it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it . 
POSITIVE:1  For the cost of this product i could not ask for more .
NEGATIVE:-3 i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
POSITIVE:2 they look fantastic . 
NEGATIVE:-2  The only issue i have against the speakers is its a little on the low tone side , but still is very good , and you can set your equalizer to make up for it .
POSITIVE:2 the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . 
POSITIVE:2 another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . 
POSITIVE:2 i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift . 
POSITIVE:2 other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips . 
POSITIVE:2 It works easily with one hand, which is important.
NEGATIVE:-2 the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . 
POSITIVE:2 The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
NEGATIVE:-1  Only issue is with updating firmware .
POSITIVE:2 While I have not had the "privilege", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.
NEGATIVE:-2 If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
POSITIVE:2 I really liked the price...
POSITIVE:1  This system is very powerful .
POSITIVE:1  This is the best sound system I have ever heard .
POSITIVE:3 Installation was as near automatic as can be. 
POSITIVE:2  Very happy with the monitor and the price ...
POSITIVE:3 1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.
POSITIVE:2 Overall, I am very pleased with it.  
POSITIVE:2 Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. 
POSITIVE:2 it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera .. 
NEGATIVE:-2 one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . 
POSITIVE:5 Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy 
NEGATIVE:-2 the general button placement is not very user friendly . 
NEGATIVE:-2 creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.  
NEGATIVE:-1  There is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver .
NEGATIVE:-1 a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
POSITIVE:3 i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision . 
POSITIVE:2 We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
POSITIVE:9 like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) . 
POSITIVE:2  This router works fine and I am able to stream video in all rooms of the house at the same time .
NEGATIVE:-2 This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.    
POSITIVE:2 N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
NEGATIVE:-2 i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . 
POSITIVE:2 the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . 
POSITIVE:4 my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both . 
NEGATIVE:-4 the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! 
POSITIVE:2 my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! 
NEGATIVE:-2  I 'm not very happy with this machine or Acer .
NEGATIVE:-3 overall , a very disappointing product . 
NEGATIVE:-2 It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working? 
POSITIVE:1 Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
POSITIVE:2 it has a classic design yet looks hip . 
POSITIVE:13 great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price . 
POSITIVE:3 anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it . 
NEGATIVE:-1 This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
POSITIVE:2 Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
POSITIVE:3 (You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
NEGATIVE:-2  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
POSITIVE:6 it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio ! 
POSITIVE:1 The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
NEGATIVE:-2 e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
POSITIVE:1  We still have our other network , which I use with my iPod , however , I will change it soon because the CISCO Valet is much better and faster .
NEGATIVE:-3 After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
POSITIVE:2 for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages . 
POSITIVE:5 works great ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. 
NEGATIVE:-2 however , it has failed to deliver on quality . 
POSITIVE:4 the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise . 
POSITIVE:3 I love this phone.
POSITIVE:5 plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
POSITIVE:3 I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down. 
POSITIVE:3 This camera is so easy to use!
POSITIVE:3 A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
POSITIVE:1 Pick your favorite color and buy it.      
NEGATIVE:-2 about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . 
POSITIVE:3 service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The price is $... more.
NEGATIVE:-2 It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
POSITIVE:2 I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
NEGATIVE:-1 Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
POSITIVE:3 I love this camera!
POSITIVE:3 I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.
POSITIVE:2 the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Hard drive screws up occasionally
POSITIVE:6 it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well . 
POSITIVE:12 overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
POSITIVE:2  I have found this little device to be quite fun to use .
POSITIVE:3 I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
NEGATIVE:-1 The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
POSITIVE:1 i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy . 
NEGATIVE:-3 my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units . 
POSITIVE:3 i highly recommend a nokia 6610 . 
POSITIVE:2  Our connection and speed immediately soared once it was online and our network was set up .
POSITIVE:2 The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
POSITIVE:2 The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example). 
NEGATIVE:-2 HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup. 
NEGATIVE:-1 The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.
NEGATIVE:-1 up , down , left , and right would have given me better control . 
POSITIVE:1 small size . 
POSITIVE:1  This monitor works great .
POSITIVE:1  The colors and everything are great .
POSITIVE:3 battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so . 
POSITIVE:8 Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  
NEGATIVE:-3 i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy . 
POSITIVE:6 another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
POSITIVE:2  it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use .
POSITIVE:2 The size of the camera is perfect. 
POSITIVE:2  The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .
NEGATIVE:-1 navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well . 
POSITIVE:5 Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  
POSITIVE:2 for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . 
POSITIVE:2 7 picture quality is excellent . 
POSITIVE:4 the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand . 
POSITIVE:3 The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
POSITIVE:6 the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software. 
POSITIVE:3 now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! 
POSITIVE:3 Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!
NEGATIVE:-1 it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . 
POSITIVE:2 it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light . 
POSITIVE:1 I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
POSITIVE:1 9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time . 
NEGATIVE:-2 There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.  
POSITIVE:2  Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .
POSITIVE:2 it has a nice color screen . 
POSITIVE:1 2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . 
POSITIVE:4 the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera . 
POSITIVE:3 great features .. . 
POSITIVE:2 the screen 's large and easily read . 
POSITIVE:6 it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too. 
POSITIVE:3 And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
NEGATIVE:-2 the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The data rate over the network storage is rather slow , but I only use it for occasional backups so it does n't bother me too much .
POSITIVE:2 looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors . 
POSITIVE:2  Good monitor for the price .
POSITIVE:3 There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
POSITIVE:1  Solid , resistant to scratches , better heat dissipation .
POSITIVE:2 Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc. 
POSITIVE:2  It seems that with every firmware release the router gets better & better .
POSITIVE:2  The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .
POSITIVE:2 the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance . 
NEGATIVE:-6 it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Within one month, my player completely died. 
POSITIVE:2 And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.  
POSITIVE:3 compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck . 
NEGATIVE:-1  When it works its fine but I have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches .
POSITIVE:3 3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
NEGATIVE:-2 the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . 
NEGATIVE:-1 P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.     
NEGATIVE:-1  However , SharePort on this new router worked 0 % of the time .
POSITIVE:4 Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
POSITIVE:2 anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing. 
POSITIVE:1  The router recognized my other wifi devices easily , and further setup was a breeze .
NEGATIVE:-2 unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type . 
POSITIVE:2 having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . 
POSITIVE:2 A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
NEGATIVE:-3 it has never worked . 
POSITIVE:2 I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
POSITIVE:3 - best in class sound 
NEGATIVE:-2 Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
POSITIVE:2  This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .
NEGATIVE:-1  My other big complaint about this monitor is the stand .
POSITIVE:3 the image quality is excellent . 
POSITIVE:2 if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer. 
POSITIVE:2 it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket . 
NEGATIVE:-3 There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens. 
NEGATIVE:-1  SLOW GUI - Be prepared to wait approximately 90 seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded `` apply '' button ... yes , 1�1\/2 minutes !
POSITIVE:3  The highs and lows sound great and personally I think the bass is at a perfect level -LRB- at 50 % -RRB- , definitely not boomy .
POSITIVE:2 the light auto-correction is awesome . 
NEGATIVE:-3 got way too many blurry pictures . 
POSITIVE:1 It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.  
POSITIVE:1  I personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets .
POSITIVE:3 navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone . 
POSITIVE:3 It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is. 
POSITIVE:2 it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market . 
POSITIVE:5 now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here . 
POSITIVE:3  This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house .
POSITIVE:1  However , the view angle on this thing is so big that you will see very clearly on any desk\/viewing situation you normally run across .
