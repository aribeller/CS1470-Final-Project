POSITIVE:2 the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad . 
POSITIVE:4 sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Range was comparable to , or possibly slightly worse than the old Linksys router I had been using for years .
POSITIVE:3 i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down . 
POSITIVE:1  The colors are clear , also .
POSITIVE:3 this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC. 
POSITIVE:2 However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter. 
NEGATIVE:-2 I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
POSITIVE:2 It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.  
POSITIVE:3 The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
NEGATIVE:-4 Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
POSITIVE:9 The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
NEGATIVE:-3 also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works . 
NEGATIVE:-1  You guys need to hire new repair technicians because the ones that are in the repair center obviously have no idea what they are doing .
POSITIVE:2 received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first. 
NEGATIVE:-3 We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.  
POSITIVE:2 So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
NEGATIVE:-1 all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective . 
POSITIVE:3 Tough as nails. 
NEGATIVE:-2 2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . " 
POSITIVE:3 There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
POSITIVE:3  No dropouts , good signal strength all over my three story house -LRB- unit is located on the top floor -RRB- and very user friendly in the setup and security aspects .
POSITIVE:2 I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.   
POSITIVE:1 there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization . 
POSITIVE:3 have had the player since xmass and love it ! 
POSITIVE:1 I did like the heft of the machine.
POSITIVE:3 Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.  
NEGATIVE:-2 you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division . 
POSITIVE:2 Download it fast to your computer
POSITIVE:2 you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . 
NEGATIVE:-3 When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
NEGATIVE:-2 If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't.
POSITIVE:1 3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
POSITIVE:2  Overall , I like the system features and performance .
POSITIVE:2 Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.    
POSITIVE:3 2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.
NEGATIVE:-2 the included earbuds were uncomfortable . 
POSITIVE:2  Overall I would reccomend these to someone who wants a set of small but effective computer speakers at a reasonable price .
NEGATIVE:-3 If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
POSITIVE:2 User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward. 
NEGATIVE:-2 the door would not close . 
POSITIVE:1 While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
POSITIVE:2 If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
POSITIVE:3 You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
POSITIVE:1  - Setup , from in the box to completely working , and programmed for 20 preset FM stations , was under 5 minutes .
NEGATIVE:-3 otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Technical support rude and unhelpful .
NEGATIVE:-1 loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well . 
POSITIVE:1 it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something . 
POSITIVE:2 at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria . 
NEGATIVE:-3 In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
NEGATIVE:-3 as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! 
POSITIVE:1  I love that it is a tablet - it is so much more convenient than a regular laptop .
NEGATIVE:-1 The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.
NEGATIVE:-4 the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with . 
POSITIVE:3 The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed. 
NEGATIVE:-3 unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks . 
POSITIVE:1  The iHome 's stereo reproduction is clearly superior .
POSITIVE:1  Dialogue is very noticeably clearer .
NEGATIVE:-2 first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds . 
POSITIVE:3 The blue backlight is pretty cool. 
POSITIVE:6 easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot . 
POSITIVE:3 great camera , great investment ! 
POSITIVE:2 this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I conclude that the Ethernet transceiver D-Link uses is not as good as that of other brands .
POSITIVE:3 In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes). 
POSITIVE:4 settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints . 
NEGATIVE:-2 After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). 
NEGATIVE:-2 the volume . 
NEGATIVE:-3 as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Nor there is a clear manual offered by the manufacturer or by Qwest , Qwest does provide some info , but nothing about what is not intuitive enough in the screen .
POSITIVE:3 i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it . 
POSITIVE:3 Sound quality? Phenomenal. 
POSITIVE:1  The set up for this product was a breeze .
NEGATIVE:-2 it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 
POSITIVE:1 small size . 
NEGATIVE:-9 I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
POSITIVE:3 without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! 
POSITIVE:1 - equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for . 
NEGATIVE:-5 They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
POSITIVE:1  Portable .
POSITIVE:2 although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone . 
POSITIVE:1 Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.  
POSITIVE:3 We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
POSITIVE:3 it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I agree with the earlier reviewer who said that there is a very limited vertical viewing angle in order to get consistent contrast .
NEGATIVE:-1 Also much less stinky.
NEGATIVE:-2 what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . 
POSITIVE:3 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . 
POSITIVE:2 i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) . 
POSITIVE:4 my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both . 
POSITIVE:4 And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
NEGATIVE:-3 the first one would n't work from the start . 
NEGATIVE:-3 As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
NEGATIVE:-2 only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . 
POSITIVE:2 The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. 
POSITIVE:3 navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Radio Quality: weak reception     
POSITIVE:1  This was very prompt standard shipping service .
POSITIVE:3 the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly 
POSITIVE:2 The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
POSITIVE:3 I never had a single problem.
POSITIVE:2 i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
POSITIVE:2  The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.      
NEGATIVE:-2 it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot . 
POSITIVE:2 Have a great and easy to use bundled software
POSITIVE:5 If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.     
NEGATIVE:-3 finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple . 
NEGATIVE:-2 since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " . 
POSITIVE:1  Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge. 
NEGATIVE:-3 We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
NEGATIVE:-2 i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler . 
NEGATIVE:-2  You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
POSITIVE:1  This product is definitely worth the purchase .
NEGATIVE:-3 The included headphones suck, so get your own.         
POSITIVE:2 i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems . 
POSITIVE:1 first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer . 
POSITIVE:1 White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag. 
POSITIVE:2 my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems . 
NEGATIVE:-2 After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).  
NEGATIVE:-3  BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.
NEGATIVE:-1  One last note , I purchased this monitor with a higher price than what you can get in the states .
POSITIVE:3 this player is an ideal purchase . 
POSITIVE:3 this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records . 
POSITIVE:2 nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear . 
NEGATIVE:-2 output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold . 
POSITIVE:2 the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with . 
NEGATIVE:-1 But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
NEGATIVE:-3 they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy . 
POSITIVE:2 i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar . 
POSITIVE:3 compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops . 
NEGATIVE:-3 This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
POSITIVE:2 the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight . 
NEGATIVE:-2 When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
POSITIVE:3 I love this phone.
NEGATIVE:-1 I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
POSITIVE:3 And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
POSITIVE:2 for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . 
POSITIVE:5 i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer . 
POSITIVE:1  I set it up in my living room and the sound was superb .
POSITIVE:3 because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible . 
POSITIVE:3 the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . 
POSITIVE:2 it works great . 
POSITIVE:1  All I can say is that this is an excellent devise .
POSITIVE:1 If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. 
POSITIVE:1 This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
POSITIVE:6 Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
POSITIVE:2  It really impressed me with the disign , the specs & the price .
POSITIVE:2 i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) 
NEGATIVE:-2 Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston.
NEGATIVE:-1  In fact others say not bright enough ?
POSITIVE:3 after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures . 
POSITIVE:5 excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures . 
POSITIVE:3 i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had . 
POSITIVE:6 The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
NEGATIVE:-2  Sometimes the system would hang , so I would have to restart the router , then get going again .
POSITIVE:2 having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers . 
POSITIVE:6 You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
NEGATIVE:-2 (I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.
POSITIVE:3 amazon is awaesome ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.  
POSITIVE:2 Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
NEGATIVE:-1  Would n't buy again because of the customer service .
NEGATIVE:-1 That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
POSITIVE:3 the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? 
POSITIVE:6 the buttons and interface are very easy to use . 
POSITIVE:3 amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping . 
POSITIVE:5 manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . 
POSITIVE:3 compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck . 
POSITIVE:3 other than that this thing is great ... 
POSITIVE:2  I love the BASS this thing gets , I have two 12 '' subs in my car , that should tell you enough if I am saying the bass is great !!
POSITIVE:1 I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
POSITIVE:6 Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
POSITIVE:1  I am above average with technical knowledge but it is easy enough for the beginner to set up .
POSITIVE:2 - very long-lasting battery life 
NEGATIVE:-1 If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.      
POSITIVE:3 Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. 
POSITIVE:3 start up is so quick – 
POSITIVE:3 Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes. 
NEGATIVE:-1  The backlight will periodically fail , the first time it happened I sent it in for warranty repair .
POSITIVE:2 i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile . 
POSITIVE:1 i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player. 
POSITIVE:1 i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; 
POSITIVE:2 5.  The price is right.
NEGATIVE:-1  halfway through the firmware upgrade progress bar , the infamous browser `` Page not found '' screen replaced most of the router 's interface .
NEGATIVE:-2 Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
POSITIVE:2 i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! 
POSITIVE:3 Goes ~3 days after a charge.
POSITIVE:2 they take excellent macro shots as well . 
POSITIVE:1 this player seems to work fine with everything else . 
POSITIVE:1  I am in the business and have seen many 19 '' LCD monitors that sell for much , much more , and aside from monitors with a higher resolution -LRB- ie 1600 x 1200 -RRB- , there is no noticable difference at all .
POSITIVE:2 i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results . 
POSITIVE:4 The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.    
POSITIVE:2 No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.    
POSITIVE:2 Its nice look is also a plus.
POSITIVE:3 first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . 
POSITIVE:2 it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included . 
POSITIVE:1  The device itself is pretty solid .
POSITIVE:2 In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
NEGATIVE:-1 As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
POSITIVE:2  The satellite speakers actually are really reach in the bass tones .
POSITIVE:6 - Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones. 
POSITIVE:2 I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
POSITIVE:2 this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  
POSITIVE:6 the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
POSITIVE:3 Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  
NEGATIVE:-2 both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going . 
POSITIVE:2  I got this for use on my truck and I 'm happy with it for the most part , it is loud and super easy to install , however you are going to want an amp for i
POSITIVE:1  My blu-ray player and WD Live TV box normally lean back , smile , and light up a smoke after a good firmware upgrade , and perform well forever thereafter .
POSITIVE:2 N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
POSITIVE:1  I do n't for-see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if I do , I will know that with this product , it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps. The service of Amazon in getting this item to me was faster than I expected and it is exactly what I knew it would be .
POSITIVE:2 this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . 
NEGATIVE:-3 * protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window . 
NEGATIVE:-2 And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
POSITIVE:3 i 'm really happy with this purchase . 
NEGATIVE:-2 is not as intuitive as I would like.  
POSITIVE:2 i 've had no problems with the software . 
POSITIVE:2  Has a great helpline.
NEGATIVE:-2  Paid more than what amazon is currently selling this router at -LRB- price depression due to poor quality no doubt -RRB- and expected to get a good quality product ... these random disconnects kills it for me .
POSITIVE:2 Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
POSITIVE:2 I could take 1/2" passes and it still didn't skip a beat.
NEGATIVE:-2 apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. 
POSITIVE:2 it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files . 
POSITIVE:3 4. The Build is just right.
POSITIVE:1 The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
POSITIVE:1 with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . 
POSITIVE:3 After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
NEGATIVE:-2 cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners . 
POSITIVE:3 An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. 
POSITIVE:2 While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
POSITIVE:2 I have the black one and adore it. 
POSITIVE:2 It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.  
POSITIVE:3 If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
NEGATIVE:-1 I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
POSITIVE:2  Really easy to use.
POSITIVE:2 night mode is clear as day . 
POSITIVE:1  Nice monitor for price but I agree with other customer review about difficulty of cable hook ups .
POSITIVE:3 I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
POSITIVE:3 It works great.
POSITIVE:3 3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
NEGATIVE:-8 creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack . 
POSITIVE:2  I took them to a different room and tested them with my mp3 player , where they worked fine and sounded pretty good .
NEGATIVE:-3 it wo n't play all of my movies . 
POSITIVE:1 the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) . 
POSITIVE:3 the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! 
POSITIVE:2  These monitors are great for the price .
NEGATIVE:-3 who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
POSITIVE:3 because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
POSITIVE:2 ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.    
POSITIVE:2 it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
POSITIVE:2  I took a chance with this new product and am pleased , except in six months it will cost half of what I paid , but that 's the price for current state of the art .
POSITIVE:1 One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player. 
POSITIVE:9 This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features. 
POSITIVE:1  I am very happy with the Acer 19-inch flat screen monitor which I received for Christmas .
POSITIVE:2 Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.  
POSITIVE:5 the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used . 
NEGATIVE:-2 one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . 
NEGATIVE:-2 each of the 4 lasted less than six months . 
NEGATIVE:-1  My only complaint to date is that it dropped the security settings once and I am not sure why ; do n't know if it was something that I did or if it was a malfunction of the router .
POSITIVE:3 Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.  
POSITIVE:2 the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough . 
POSITIVE:2 As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen. 
NEGATIVE:-2  First of all , I disagree with any suggestions that the bass on this system is boomy in a bad way .
POSITIVE:1 it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . 
POSITIVE:3  The images are vivid and crisp , the text and fonts are very clear .
POSITIVE:2 Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
POSITIVE:6 (It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!     
POSITIVE:3 Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums. 
POSITIVE:2 i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . 
NEGATIVE:-1  My only grips are the incompatibility with XP and the USB hub in the display .
NEGATIVE:-1 This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
POSITIVE:2 i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper . 
POSITIVE:1 the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt . 
POSITIVE:4 the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The labeling of firmware itself is a mystery and suggests that this company is just scrambling to put out fires .
POSITIVE:1 For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
POSITIVE:2 If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  
POSITIVE:2 This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
NEGATIVE:-2 made the camera totally inoperable . 
NEGATIVE:-2 2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
POSITIVE:2 The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less. 
POSITIVE:2 there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things. 
NEGATIVE:-2 the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . 
POSITIVE:3 great features .. . 
POSITIVE:2 yes , the features are numerous . 
POSITIVE:2 controls easy yo use and easy to get to . 
POSITIVE:2  So far , I am super happy with this small yet powerful enough laptop .
POSITIVE:4 I love the performance and features of this router.
NEGATIVE:-3 Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
POSITIVE:3 I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).
NEGATIVE:-2 What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!
NEGATIVE:-1 They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  
POSITIVE:1  This 4 X 3 monitor fits my space very well .
POSITIVE:1 and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 
POSITIVE:3 it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up . 
POSITIVE:2 The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod. 
POSITIVE:3 no matter the format . 
POSITIVE:4 the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to . 
POSITIVE:3 If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
NEGATIVE:-2  The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the speakers on the monitor are a little weak , but that 's really to be expected is n't it ...
POSITIVE:3 :! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
NEGATIVE:-1  The problem is that the fastest speed anything has connected to it has been around 72MB\/s , even when in the same room .
POSITIVE:2 I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
POSITIVE:2 - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company . 
POSITIVE:1  Seems like a good product .
POSITIVE:1  Kudos Apple - though your products are of superb quality , your support is equal to that .
POSITIVE:1  At first I dealt with this as 18mbps was still REALLY fast .
NEGATIVE:-2 the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network . 
POSITIVE:2  It works flawlessly during installation of cx501 .
NEGATIVE:-2 the dvd player just would't recognize them . 
POSITIVE:2  I am very happy with this product and the price was very reasonable given its features and specifications .
POSITIVE:2 But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
POSITIVE:1 so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
POSITIVE:4 proven canon built quality and lens . 
POSITIVE:3 Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
POSITIVE:6 There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
POSITIVE:13 Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.  
POSITIVE:3 The phone is sturdy.
POSITIVE:1  the soft orange glow at the base is a nice nightlight .
POSITIVE:2 the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work . 
POSITIVE:3 The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
POSITIVE:2 nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them . 
POSITIVE:2 This camera is bulletproof. 
NEGATIVE:-2 pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ? 
NEGATIVE:-3 this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. 
POSITIVE:1 accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive . 
POSITIVE:1  I have very high praise for the tech support people .
POSITIVE:1 If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  
POSITIVE:2 So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own. 
POSITIVE:1  FAR SURPASSES ANYTHING I 'VE HEARD TO DATE FOR THEIR SUPERIOR SOUND .
POSITIVE:3 It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
NEGATIVE:-2 There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
POSITIVE:2 when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is . 
POSITIVE:3 I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
NEGATIVE:-1  Its annoying when you pay $ 100 + for a router and it does n't work as it is supposed straight out of the box !
NEGATIVE:-2 the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Easy enough but it did not work .
NEGATIVE:-3 There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
POSITIVE:3 I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
POSITIVE:3 I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
NEGATIVE:-2 1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) 
NEGATIVE:-1 NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.  
NEGATIVE:-2 During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
POSITIVE:1  Much faster than my previous Acer One Netbook with single processor .
POSITIVE:2 Everything shines of quality.  
NEGATIVE:-2 The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
NEGATIVE:-2 Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
POSITIVE:1 The Nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650: you know the 3650, those bulbous, formless, big phones a few unfortunate ATT customers are carrying around.
POSITIVE:3 Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm. 
NEGATIVE:-2 This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
POSITIVE:2 just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . 
POSITIVE:1  It is smaller than I expected when I ordered it , but as it turns out , so much the better .
POSITIVE:2  Good range & speed .
POSITIVE:6 The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
NEGATIVE:-2 fm receiver - it has none . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Unfortunately my Verizon 3G signal strength where I live is very weak -LRB- 1-2 bars -RRB- so I could n't get much more than 1 Mbps download speed but I will test this again when I am in a location with decent signal strength .
POSITIVE:3 This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.
POSITIVE:2 I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
POSITIVE:3 this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it . 
NEGATIVE:-6 negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button . 
NEGATIVE:-2 on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside . 
POSITIVE:1 i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered. 
NEGATIVE:-3 First, it serious, serious installation problems.
POSITIVE:6 the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject . 
NEGATIVE:-3 b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
POSITIVE:2 I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
POSITIVE:3 This is a great diaper pail.
NEGATIVE:-3 after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd . 
POSITIVE:2  This netbook is closer to the notebook powers but still very cheap .
POSITIVE:1  Tech support was very pleasent and helpfull once you actually got someone .
POSITIVE:3 We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.
NEGATIVE:-3 HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.  
POSITIVE:1 First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
NEGATIVE:-3 do not buy this product -- 
NEGATIVE:-2 I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. 
NEGATIVE:-3 got way too many blurry pictures . 
POSITIVE:4 I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
POSITIVE:1 6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model . 
POSITIVE:3 Photos are pretty darned good!
POSITIVE:2 The router works fine for both wired and wireless.  
NEGATIVE:-3 update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product ! 
POSITIVE:3 What impressed me most was the sound.  
POSITIVE:3 the battery life is amazing . 
POSITIVE:3 I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
POSITIVE:5 i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
NEGATIVE:-2 3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files . 
POSITIVE:2 great phone , i 'd buy another . 
POSITIVE:2 I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
NEGATIVE:-2 however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line . 
POSITIVE:6 It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
POSITIVE:3 And it is very easy to clean.
NEGATIVE:-1 The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
NEGATIVE:-1  The controls are hard to see and not intuitive .
POSITIVE:3 the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better . 
NEGATIVE:-3 if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders . 
POSITIVE:2 I am getting better speeds on all my web programs. 
NEGATIVE:-6 the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out . 
POSITIVE:6 the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Now when the backlight fails , I have to leave it unplugged overnight and it works the next day .
POSITIVE:4 not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  
NEGATIVE:-1 Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
POSITIVE:2  Living in a small college apartment the E90s and E100s were beautiful , but a bit overkill for what I needed .
POSITIVE:6 Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
POSITIVE:2 canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out . 
POSITIVE:2 the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does. 
POSITIVE:2 it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones . 
POSITIVE:2 I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.  
NEGATIVE:-2 but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working . 
POSITIVE:1  Purchased this item because of reviews and price .
POSITIVE:8 Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  
POSITIVE:1 The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds. 
POSITIVE:2 i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player . 
POSITIVE:1 Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!
NEGATIVE:-2 sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . 
POSITIVE:2 I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
NEGATIVE:-1 Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
NEGATIVE:-3 The customer support is pathetic.
POSITIVE:3 I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
NEGATIVE:-1 (...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging. 
NEGATIVE:-2  The remote control and reciever not so good .
POSITIVE:3 as said before this works perfectly . 
POSITIVE:1  I did not even have to hit the `` auto tune '' button , it just worked instantly .
NEGATIVE:-2 OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
POSITIVE:1  We are well pleased with the monitor and the company .
POSITIVE:3 I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
POSITIVE:1  - Looks fantastic , esp w\/iPhone4 docked !!
POSITIVE:5 The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it. 
POSITIVE:2 people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection . 
POSITIVE:2 I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.  
POSITIVE:1 I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
POSITIVE:1 it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive . 
POSITIVE:2 I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.  
NEGATIVE:-3 mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs . 
POSITIVE:2 i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it . 
POSITIVE:5 It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.  
NEGATIVE:-3 But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
POSITIVE:2  As always , super quick shipping by Amazon , items arrived in great shape .
NEGATIVE:-2 But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.
POSITIVE:2 So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
NEGATIVE:-2 The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
POSITIVE:4 it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented . 
NEGATIVE:-6 the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par . 
POSITIVE:5 The bass is deep and the treble is clear.
NEGATIVE:-1  There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
POSITIVE:3 i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic . 
POSITIVE:2 i find this to be a great feature . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".  
NEGATIVE:-1  My biggest problem with this speaker is the incompatibility with my 2nd generation iPod Nano .
POSITIVE:2  This audio bar has a great sound , even when i turn it up to the highest level on my laptop .
POSITIVE:4 It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy! 
NEGATIVE:-1  The sound quality has been poor since day one , the base constantly drops calls , and now there seems to be some sort of short circuit in the base -- we can no longer use the AC adapter with the base or it turns off completely .
POSITIVE:3 I really love this phone...
POSITIVE:2  These speakers are a greatg value I use them as rear speakers with polk fronts and center .
POSITIVE:5 The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!  
POSITIVE:2  The USB port on the back is a nice feature .
NEGATIVE:-2 so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out . 
POSITIVE:1 basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used . 
POSITIVE:1  The sound is just fine. 
POSITIVE:1  I tried setting the router up with the laptop and it connected easily and hooked me up to the internet in under 15 minutes .
NEGATIVE:-3 after two weeks the picture kept freezing . 
POSITIVE:1 Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
POSITIVE:1  <p> I am very happy about my investment and the quality service of Amazon and J&R store .
NEGATIVE:-3 video output stopped workin . 
POSITIVE:1  I highly recommend this device !
NEGATIVE:-2 The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac. 
NEGATIVE:-2 No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
NEGATIVE:-2 Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
POSITIVE:1 a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
POSITIVE:2 So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.
POSITIVE:2 As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
POSITIVE:1  Just an average user getting good value in this product .
POSITIVE:1 The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
POSITIVE:2  Overall, this product is AWESOME. 
POSITIVE:3 anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception . 
NEGATIVE:-2 If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. 
POSITIVE:1  Thanks to Amazon 's amazing return policy , I was able to return the product at no loss on my part .
NEGATIVE:-2 There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons. 
POSITIVE:2 the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long . 
POSITIVE:4  Hi , I just got this , and let me tell you is an awsome monitor , Size , looking and 3d is awsome good with this LCD .
POSITIVE:6 the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly . 
POSITIVE:2 The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
NEGATIVE:-2 having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying . 
POSITIVE:2 the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did . 
NEGATIVE:-1 This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see. 
NEGATIVE:-2 it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Bottom line : it did n't work the way it was supposed to so we 're returning it We bought this router for our two computers .
POSITIVE:3 Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set. 
POSITIVE:1  I love this speakers .
POSITIVE:2 This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
POSITIVE:2 The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus. 
POSITIVE:3 i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
POSITIVE:3 Let the Champ win you over!
NEGATIVE:-2 i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  
POSITIVE:1  Again , the sounds were spot-on and projected from where they should , the front of the TV .
NEGATIVE:-2  The user support service isn't too great either.  
POSITIVE:3 No down time, great signal strength.  
POSITIVE:1  Wire runs through the body of the stand - giving it a very clean look .
POSITIVE:2 I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
NEGATIVE:-2 The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
NEGATIVE:-1 The touch pad does take a little getting used to. 
POSITIVE:1 although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . 
NEGATIVE:-1 i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual . 
NEGATIVE:-2 4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
POSITIVE:4 it is very light weight and has a good signal strength . 
NEGATIVE:-3 After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.
POSITIVE:6 All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
NEGATIVE:-1 If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
NEGATIVE:-4 the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking . 
POSITIVE:2 Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products. 
NEGATIVE:-1 it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light . 
POSITIVE:3 I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
POSITIVE:3 What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
POSITIVE:3 It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
POSITIVE:2 another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen . 
POSITIVE:3  The Acer Monitor has an extremely bright screen and its design allows the placement in an area -LRB- from a heighth perspective -RRB- that many 20 '' screens will not fit in .
POSITIVE:8 The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
NEGATIVE:-1 This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
NEGATIVE:-1 All in all, not very good.
POSITIVE:4 it looks great - and is loaded with features . 
POSITIVE:2 The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire. 
POSITIVE:1  - Tuner quality is good .
POSITIVE:3 You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
POSITIVE:1 But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
NEGATIVE:-2 Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
POSITIVE:3 This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
POSITIVE:3 after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
POSITIVE:1 7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch . 
POSITIVE:3 The diaper champ is the best!
POSITIVE:5 Setup is totally breeze and Linksys's web site is pretty easy to navigate.  
POSITIVE:3 I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
POSITIVE:5 My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now. 
POSITIVE:1 Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
NEGATIVE:-2 If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.
POSITIVE:3 the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it . 
POSITIVE:3 Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.
NEGATIVE:-2 it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Symantec should give us all a refund and apology!
NEGATIVE:-1  The buttons are confusing and super small .
NEGATIVE:-3 and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control . 
NEGATIVE:-2 e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
NEGATIVE:-2 player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 . 
POSITIVE:2 Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways. 
POSITIVE:8 4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) 
POSITIVE:2 i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before . 
NEGATIVE:-2 my only significant complaint is sound quality . 
POSITIVE:2 uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple . 
NEGATIVE:-6 but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments . 
POSITIVE:3  However , if speed , reliability , and power to transmit a signal across the house are your requirements , then this router will do the job .
NEGATIVE:-3  FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature. 
POSITIVE:1  Great picture .
POSITIVE:5 now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here . 
NEGATIVE:-3 we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working . 
NEGATIVE:-3 it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . 
NEGATIVE:-1 What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  
NEGATIVE:-2 There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.  
POSITIVE:2 1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone . 
POSITIVE:2 I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini. 
POSITIVE:6 i am very pleased with its quality and durability . 
POSITIVE:3 the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive . 
POSITIVE:2 it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ). 
NEGATIVE:-2 I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
NEGATIVE:-2 i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times . 
POSITIVE:1  You should use the firmware on the DD-WRT website instead .
POSITIVE:3 I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.
POSITIVE:2 It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
POSITIVE:2  SUMMARY - I 'm happy to say that despite much frustration with setup , the Bufflo Nfinity G300N is working fantastic as a wireless access point with great range .
NEGATIVE:-2 Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
NEGATIVE:-2 also , the lens cap design is flawed . 
POSITIVE:2 connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! 
POSITIVE:2 A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
POSITIVE:3 - outstanding signal reception 
POSITIVE:2 this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities . 
POSITIVE:2 Having done all this, I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal. 
POSITIVE:2 Versatile and stylish.	 
POSITIVE:2 This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it. 
POSITIVE:1 All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price. 
POSITIVE:1 has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. 
POSITIVE:6 if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500. 
NEGATIVE:-2 i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . " 
NEGATIVE:-1 Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
NEGATIVE:-2 i tried called apex cust service , no help . 
NEGATIVE:-2 At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
POSITIVE:1 While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.  
POSITIVE:3 The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
POSITIVE:3 6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.
NEGATIVE:-2 Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.
POSITIVE:2 silverish color really adds a special touch . 
POSITIVE:1 i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 door broke after a month . 
POSITIVE:1  THIS ROUTER IS AWESOM BUT IT WILL ONLY SUPPORT 1 XBOX WE HAVE 3 AND YOU CAN NEVER GET MORE THAN 1 TO HAVE A OPEN NAT TYPE THE OTHERS ARE USUALY MODERATE OR STRICT WHEN I CONTACED SUPPORT THEY WERE VERY NICE AND TRIED THRE BEST TO GET IT WORKING RIGHT BUT TO NO AVAIL BOTTOM LINE IF YOU JUST HAVE A COMPUTER A LAPTOP AND 1 360 YOU WILL BE FINE AND VERY SECURE THIS ROUTER IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY
POSITIVE:2 On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. 
NEGATIVE:-1 however , the creative software is not real intuitive . 
POSITIVE:4 while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece . 
POSITIVE:2 Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.  
POSITIVE:3 I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
POSITIVE:3 All in all, this is a great phone.
POSITIVE:2 great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc. 
POSITIVE:2 I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great. 
POSITIVE:2 finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy . 
POSITIVE:1 battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . 
POSITIVE:2 it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
POSITIVE:2 I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
NEGATIVE:-1  Expensive , but for us -- well worth it .
NEGATIVE:-1 only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing . 
NEGATIVE:-2 we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason . 
POSITIVE:3  Item shipped out quickly , was in good condition , came with easy to use set-up disk ... we have n't had to 're - set ' the router at all so far since it 's delivery , so my wife is no longer giving me the business about losing her wireless internet connection on her laptop ... added security benefits , neighbors no longer hogging signal , well worth the purchase price !
POSITIVE:1  This is a good product .
NEGATIVE:-2 it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . 
POSITIVE:6 Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)
POSITIVE:1  Not that Apple computers break down often but this is cheap insurance for 3 years .
POSITIVE:1  With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive. 
POSITIVE:1 I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
NEGATIVE:-2 the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . 
POSITIVE:2 the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Sometimes, various applications crash.
POSITIVE:2 the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem). 
POSITIVE:4 this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature . 
NEGATIVE:-1  When it works its fine but I have gone through two monitors now both with defective switches .
NEGATIVE:-1 If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
NEGATIVE:-1  I deducted a star because , when I put my iPod and iPad on full volume , the speaker 's bass began to completely ruin the sound .
POSITIVE:1  Pros : Competitive Cost Win 7 Home premium HDMI port -LRB- I could watch the Amazon instant videos on my HDTV and its delivering great .
NEGATIVE:-5 less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . " 
NEGATIVE:-1 it's not my first choice in cameras,
POSITIVE:1 Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
POSITIVE:1 Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes. 
NEGATIVE:-1 3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software . 
POSITIVE:3 It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
NEGATIVE:-3 the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck . 
POSITIVE:9 I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
POSITIVE:2  The product I rate five stars, 
POSITIVE:5 Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
POSITIVE:2 This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
NEGATIVE:-2 The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
POSITIVE:1 In fact, it supports the new WPA encryption standard, which is WAY better than WEP.  
NEGATIVE:-4 So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
POSITIVE:2  The padded underside is great even when set on bare legs and the unit is angled for a comfortable typing experience .
POSITIVE:1 Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs. 
POSITIVE:1  The computer direct processing and shipping was outrageously fast .
POSITIVE:5  The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out. 
POSITIVE:3 i highly recommend it . 
POSITIVE:4 All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.  
POSITIVE:2 just point and shoot and the photos were great . 
POSITIVE:4 the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's . 
POSITIVE:3 Flawless. 
POSITIVE:2 interface - practically seamless . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) . 
POSITIVE:2 The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example). 
NEGATIVE:-2 However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
POSITIVE:3 This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
POSITIVE:4 price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad . 
NEGATIVE:-1 1) It is perhaps too small. 
POSITIVE:2  An excellent product with excellent and typically superb Logitech production values .
NEGATIVE:-2 The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
POSITIVE:2 The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
POSITIVE:1 It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.  
POSITIVE:2 The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
NEGATIVE:-1 The only complaint I have is that the 1/4" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4" bits.
POSITIVE:2  This speaker mount is suitable for small speaker .
POSITIVE:3 Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
NEGATIVE:-3 what a junk . 
POSITIVE:4 great quality picture and features . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
POSITIVE:2 It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
NEGATIVE:-6  ##Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
NEGATIVE:-1 the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 
POSITIVE:3 It's far better than all others on the market.
NEGATIVE:-2 the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless . 
POSITIVE:2 for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages . 
POSITIVE:3  I can see a drastic difference between this monitor and Dell Ultrasharp in terms of contrast , brightness and viewing angles .
POSITIVE:2 I recently had to run a 3/4" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.
POSITIVE:12 overall build quality, good macros-results, impressive video-quality, good pictures with flash (good colours, sharp results), excellent auto white balance.
POSITIVE:4 the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . 
POSITIVE:1 Smooth plunging mechanism.
POSITIVE:2 Overall, I've been very impressed with the player. 
POSITIVE:3 Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
POSITIVE:3 This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
POSITIVE:3  Good quality for a small portable speaker .
POSITIVE:2  I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.  
POSITIVE:1 the sound from the player is ok . 
POSITIVE:2 it has a nice color screen . 
POSITIVE:2 just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc. 
POSITIVE:1 Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
POSITIVE:3 For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
NEGATIVE:-2 i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
NEGATIVE:-2 the player 's mechanics are also flawed . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . 
POSITIVE:3 but for what i do use it is perfect . 
POSITIVE:6 I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
NEGATIVE:-2 I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
NEGATIVE:-1 the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile . 
POSITIVE:2 The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion. 
POSITIVE:8 other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod . 
NEGATIVE:-1  This means that the vga connection will not work with my computers .
POSITIVE:3 by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
POSITIVE:2 I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
NEGATIVE:-1 I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
NEGATIVE:-2 on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd . 
POSITIVE:2 it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly . 
POSITIVE:2  Very sturdy and strong.
NEGATIVE:-2 Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.  
NEGATIVE:-3 DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
NEGATIVE:-1  The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. 
NEGATIVE:-1 I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
POSITIVE:1  Setup was very easy .
POSITIVE:5 The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
POSITIVE:2 I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
POSITIVE:2 i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots . 
POSITIVE:1  This item was the most inexpensive 17 inch monitor available to me at the time I made the purchase .
POSITIVE:2  Very happy with the monitor and the price ...
POSITIVE:2 11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player 
NEGATIVE:-2 the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! 
POSITIVE:3 the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) . 
POSITIVE:3 the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product . 
POSITIVE:3 very simple to use . 
POSITIVE:3 the menus are very easy to navigate . 
POSITIVE:3 honestly , i love this player . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.  
POSITIVE:2 everything else about the camera is great . 
POSITIVE:3 anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work . 
POSITIVE:2 oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^ 
NEGATIVE:-2 After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out. 
POSITIVE:2 the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle . 
NEGATIVE:-2  Slow to download and run certain programs Wish you the best and hope my review helped !
NEGATIVE:-1  I 'm still very frustrated with some of the properties , but now that I have saved equalizer settings and know I have to open up my sound card 's control panel every time I switch between music and videos or games , the sound is much more acceptable .
POSITIVE:1  Set up was smooth , and both wired and wireless devices worked very well on it .
POSITIVE:2  and I love extremely low , loud bass , and as such , I suplemented the system with a sweet JBL sub .
POSITIVE:1  This Pinnacle speaker bar is well worth the money .
POSITIVE:6 I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
NEGATIVE:-1 My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
NEGATIVE:-1  The hard drive I had attached to the USB port was sometimes accessible , sometimes not .
POSITIVE:6 The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
POSITIVE:4 i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
POSITIVE:2 the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . 
POSITIVE:2 I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
NEGATIVE:-1  There are a few things that I do n't like about the design .
NEGATIVE:-3 my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Exasperated at 3 AM , I called it quits and will be sending this awful , deceptive product back .
POSITIVE:2 The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
NEGATIVE:-2 other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system . 
POSITIVE:3 Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.
POSITIVE:2 it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds . 
POSITIVE:2   However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority. 
POSITIVE:1 the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it . 
POSITIVE:2 It is a nice router in all ways but one.  
POSITIVE:3 By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do. 
NEGATIVE:-3 i think this is it 's biggest flaw . 
POSITIVE:2 By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.  
NEGATIVE:-3 some dvd 's i rented would not play . 
POSITIVE:2 I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
POSITIVE:2 the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing . 
NEGATIVE:-2 You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
POSITIVE:2 i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy . 
NEGATIVE:-2 because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product . 
POSITIVE:3 The size is tiny, which I love.
POSITIVE:3 it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . 
POSITIVE:1 radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in . 
POSITIVE:1  This product is good enough to integrate my clarion cx501 to my Toyota camry 2001 mode .
NEGATIVE:-1 1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? 
NEGATIVE:-1 software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered . 
POSITIVE:2 Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours. 
NEGATIVE:-1 it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd . 
POSITIVE:1  The speaker bar response was spot-on .
POSITIVE:3 Excellent diaper disposal unit.
POSITIVE:3 it 's worth it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it . 
POSITIVE:3 lastly , the price is fantastic : 
NEGATIVE:-2 However, this product performed well below my expectation.  
POSITIVE:3 Sound: This is where I love Zen the most. 
NEGATIVE:-1 Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
NEGATIVE:-2 The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
POSITIVE:3 As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'. 
NEGATIVE:-3 this is ridiculous . 
POSITIVE:1  The DIR-655 was so easy to setup it was almost too easy .
POSITIVE:1 t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's . 
POSITIVE:3 It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
POSITIVE:3 I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  
POSITIVE:3 The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
POSITIVE:3 i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class . 
NEGATIVE:-1  They said the product was defective and said they would send a new one .
NEGATIVE:-4 2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. 
POSITIVE:2  I was looking for portability and good battery life and this product delivers both .
NEGATIVE:-2 Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
POSITIVE:3 I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
POSITIVE:2 Works pretty well. 
POSITIVE:2 this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in . 
POSITIVE:3 I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones. 
POSITIVE:3 These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. 
NEGATIVE:-2 My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  
POSITIVE:1 - bright , visible screen 
NEGATIVE:-2 Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
NEGATIVE:-3 It's too bad, though, that !
POSITIVE:2 i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . 
POSITIVE:2 If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
NEGATIVE:-3 This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
POSITIVE:1 i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . 
POSITIVE:3 Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
POSITIVE:2 The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
POSITIVE:1 great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one). 
POSITIVE:1 A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition. 
POSITIVE:3 All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.     
POSITIVE:3 this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! 
POSITIVE:3 I've had no problems w/ this phone.
POSITIVE:1 I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).   
NEGATIVE:-2 this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . 
POSITIVE:2 first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better . 
POSITIVE:1 The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
NEGATIVE:-1  If you are not picky about image quality , go for it .
POSITIVE:3 Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
NEGATIVE:-1  I guess I do n't have to mention that I do not recommend this product , that I most likely will return it and keep my fingers off Cisco\/Linksys stuff in future .
POSITIVE:1 the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery . 
POSITIVE:3 this is quite simply the best you can ask for . 
POSITIVE:1  I bought this monitor from computer direct a couple months ago , and I have been very satisfied with it so far .
NEGATIVE:-1  Cons : - I think the satellites look ugly .
POSITIVE:1  It came well-packaged .
POSITIVE:3 This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
POSITIVE:4 It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up. 
NEGATIVE:-4 it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
NEGATIVE:-3 I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.  
NEGATIVE:-3 after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty . 
POSITIVE:2 There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
POSITIVE:1 In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
POSITIVE:1  Overall a sweet machine .
POSITIVE:3 additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. ) 
NEGATIVE:-3 Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
POSITIVE:3 By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
POSITIVE:1 turn the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date. 
POSITIVE:2 I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.  
POSITIVE:1  full spectrum sound from full base to great highs .
NEGATIVE:-2 My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
POSITIVE:1 The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use. 
NEGATIVE:-2 other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack . 
POSITIVE:2 The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company. 
NEGATIVE:-1  I do n't think the external switch is much of a feature because in the end , you have to learn how to identify IP addresses , switch the router from from a dynamic to static IP address , and assign a static IP address that is compatible with your router or modem .
POSITIVE:3 simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . 
POSITIVE:6 I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
NEGATIVE:-1 Some more manual control would have been nice. 
POSITIVE:2 the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods . 
NEGATIVE:-1 As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance. 
POSITIVE:2 i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
POSITIVE:4 recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately . 
POSITIVE:1 4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . 
POSITIVE:3 Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
NEGATIVE:-1 T610 supports only midi files.
POSITIVE:2 battery life is good for a phone of this size . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
NEGATIVE:-4 It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
POSITIVE:2 It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  
NEGATIVE:-2 at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice . 
NEGATIVE:-2 6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
POSITIVE:2 it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted . 
NEGATIVE:-5 This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
NEGATIVE:-3 The installation software CD crashed repeatedly. 
POSITIVE:3  These INSTEN `` Folding Speakers '' are a surprisingly good value for decent quality portable speakers !
POSITIVE:1 i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation . 
POSITIVE:3 The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge. 
POSITIVE:2 overall i like the unit . 
POSITIVE:1 When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.   
POSITIVE:2 i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
POSITIVE:2  The model is also very clean and nice , and the software is very user-friendly .
NEGATIVE:-3 the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. . 
NEGATIVE:-1 a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . 
POSITIVE:2 considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player . 
POSITIVE:2  The mount is easy to use ... it 's just velcro straps to tie up on the handlebars .
POSITIVE:3 Don't worry this player rocks.  
NEGATIVE:-2  You can blame the bad chat support or the repair technicians for that because I gave all the information I could .
NEGATIVE:-2  The only problem I have is the clicker on the mouse pad is stiff .
POSITIVE:3 I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.    
POSITIVE:2 The size of the camera is perfect. 
POSITIVE:1 i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred . 
NEGATIVE:-5 after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent . 
POSITIVE:1 i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags . 
POSITIVE:3 all in all suprisingly easy to use . 
POSITIVE:2 I must have gotten a good one.
POSITIVE:1 As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
POSITIVE:3 the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to . 
POSITIVE:3  It does not distort ; video and pictures look great .
NEGATIVE:-2 typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . 
NEGATIVE:-3 This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
POSITIVE:2 The Zen offered a great alternative. 
POSITIVE:12 It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
POSITIVE:1 the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones . 
POSITIVE:2 Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.
POSITIVE:2 despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography . 
POSITIVE:4 2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection . 
NEGATIVE:-3 - Not compatible with Audible.com books.  
NEGATIVE:-3 it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why . 
POSITIVE:3 i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
POSITIVE:8 i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price . 
POSITIVE:2 There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
POSITIVE:3 I still can't believe how fast it starts up. 
POSITIVE:2 The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server. 
NEGATIVE:-1 The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
NEGATIVE:-3 Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
NEGATIVE:-3 creative software stinks . 
POSITIVE:2 It feels tiny in the hand without it. 
POSITIVE:1 I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
NEGATIVE:-2 But those 2 come up every time.
POSITIVE:4 3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
NEGATIVE:-3 the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use . 
POSITIVE:3 (we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
POSITIVE:1  Our purchase of an Acer Monitor was just as we expected .
POSITIVE:2 looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors . 
POSITIVE:2 just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date . 
POSITIVE:2 i have no complaints with this mp3 player . 
POSITIVE:3 So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
NEGATIVE:-1  Initially the sound was low and sounded `` off '' .
NEGATIVE:-2 - included creative software is pretty poor . 
POSITIVE:2 it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . ) 
POSITIVE:2 so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing . 
POSITIVE:1  The operation with the increased memory option was flawless with the Windows 7 Home Professional instaled otherwise other netbooks with Windows 7 Starter doesnt allow , and nobody mention this .
NEGATIVE:-2 I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
POSITIVE:3 This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
NEGATIVE:-1 I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  
POSITIVE:1  Other than that the sound is so crisp and clear and I would still purchase this all over again .
NEGATIVE:-3 so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! 
POSITIVE:2 if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer. 
POSITIVE:2 the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
NEGATIVE:-3 4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
POSITIVE:4 this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) . 
POSITIVE:3 3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
POSITIVE:1  I 'm not a person well read in technology but this is just an absolutely wonderful computer .
NEGATIVE:-2 the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . 
POSITIVE:2 after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Some may not like the horn tweeters , as they tend to sound too hot .
POSITIVE:2 it 's size also makes it ideal for travel . 
POSITIVE:2 they look fantastic . 
POSITIVE:3 it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid . 
POSITIVE:2 Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
POSITIVE:2 The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.  
NEGATIVE:-2 rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . 
POSITIVE:3 this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . 
POSITIVE:2 The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
POSITIVE:8 I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.   
NEGATIVE:-2 A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
POSITIVE:2 when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with . 
POSITIVE:4 the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . 
POSITIVE:4 The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
POSITIVE:6 the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro . 
NEGATIVE:-1 while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets . 
POSITIVE:3 For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
POSITIVE:3 Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
POSITIVE:1 It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
NEGATIVE:-3 i will never buy a creative product again . 
NEGATIVE:-2 when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . 
POSITIVE:2  I am not to savy with a computer but the D-link is very easy to install and set up .
POSITIVE:1 9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time . 
POSITIVE:2  I purchased three of these Acer 19 '' at very good rates from Amazon ... we are extremely pleased with the clarity and sharpness .
POSITIVE:1 I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
POSITIVE:3 (You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
NEGATIVE:-2 Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
POSITIVE:2 Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys. 
POSITIVE:2 We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
POSITIVE:2 Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. 
POSITIVE:3 i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy . 
POSITIVE:4 i like the size and weight of this little critter . 
NEGATIVE:-6 I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
POSITIVE:2 The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard. 
NEGATIVE:-2 All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
POSITIVE:10 the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
POSITIVE:1 8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). 
POSITIVE:2 great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it . 
POSITIVE:3 excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players . 
POSITIVE:2  The screen is a very pleasing matte , and the colors are great .
NEGATIVE:-1 Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.     
POSITIVE:3 since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Assembly is a little awkward because the drawings are n't that great .
POSITIVE:1 We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).
POSITIVE:2 the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. 
POSITIVE:2 Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.  
NEGATIVE:-1 The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
POSITIVE:2  The D-Link has a ton of features including USB printer sharing , two wireless networks -LRB- one not connected to the LAN -RRB- , and a really comprehensive settings menu .
NEGATIVE:-3 headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature . 
POSITIVE:5 the phone is small , light , and very attractive . 
POSITIVE:2  The ability to connect an external hard drive to the router is a nice feature when backing up from my various computers .
NEGATIVE:-2 the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . 
POSITIVE:2 New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration. 
POSITIVE:2 The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.  
POSITIVE:5 great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.  
POSITIVE:3 this thing seriously is a good player though . 
NEGATIVE:-2 after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! 
POSITIVE:1  All the latest Acer stuff is top notch !
POSITIVE:3 i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email . 
POSITIVE:2  Shipping was fast and they are very easy to set up .
POSITIVE:2 I love the touchpade controls. 
POSITIVE:3 But the product iself is great.  
POSITIVE:6 This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.
NEGATIVE:-2 Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
NEGATIVE:-1 After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem. 
POSITIVE:2 The extra Gb is just a bonus.  
NEGATIVE:-1  material is on the cheap side .
POSITIVE:2 Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.
NEGATIVE:-1 3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
NEGATIVE:-2 - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage . 
NEGATIVE:-4 Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
POSITIVE:3 All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.
POSITIVE:2 price ! 
POSITIVE:3 For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.  
POSITIVE:4 All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
POSITIVE:2 so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! 
POSITIVE:1 but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead . 
NEGATIVE:-3 That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
POSITIVE:3 Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
NEGATIVE:-3 i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason . 
POSITIVE:1  The bass is solid and can be quite impressive if turned up .
NEGATIVE:-3 i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . 
POSITIVE:2 when you learn how to change some settings, you can make the quality even better 
POSITIVE:6 PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
POSITIVE:2 even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio . 
POSITIVE:3 overall , i highly recommend this phone . 
NEGATIVE:-2   My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up. 
NEGATIVE:-3 The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
NEGATIVE:-2 when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there : 
NEGATIVE:-3 i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
POSITIVE:1 Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings. 
NEGATIVE:-2 when the player was working it was great ,but . 
POSITIVE:2 my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
POSITIVE:5 simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use . 
POSITIVE:2 newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
POSITIVE:6 the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics . 
POSITIVE:3  Great color display , sharp picture , and just the right size for my desk .
POSITIVE:3 i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all . 
POSITIVE:1  Well it had good power but no precision at all .
POSITIVE:2 i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great . 
POSITIVE:2 Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality. 
NEGATIVE:-2 The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
NEGATIVE:-1 it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack . 
POSITIVE:2 nokia does not disappoint in this model . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones.
NEGATIVE:-3 Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
POSITIVE:2 After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine. 
POSITIVE:2 They're easy to use. 
POSITIVE:5 it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich . 
POSITIVE:1  and the sound well there is no complaints about that .
POSITIVE:3 I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
POSITIVE:2 Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
POSITIVE:3 The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch. 
POSITIVE:2 to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod . 
POSITIVE:2 the price compared to the ipod is great . 
POSITIVE:2 the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun . 
POSITIVE:3 apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players . 
POSITIVE:2 OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
POSITIVE:2  The speakers themselves sound really good .
POSITIVE:1 the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any . 
POSITIVE:2 yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The customer support is very rude .
POSITIVE:3 you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
NEGATIVE:-1 The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
NEGATIVE:-3 because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack. 
NEGATIVE:-3 namely, it wouldnt sync.
POSITIVE:1 It doesn't bog down under load.
NEGATIVE:-2 ( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format . 
NEGATIVE:-3  The network was down , the Internet connection was gone , and the router was completely unresponsive .
NEGATIVE:-2 I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.
NEGATIVE:-3 Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.  
POSITIVE:1  However , the view angle on this thing is so big that you will see very clearly on any desk\/viewing situation you normally run across .
NEGATIVE:-1  However , since I am in an office , I normally keep them at a pretty low volume , and at low volumes , they sound a little weak .
NEGATIVE:-2 unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything . 
POSITIVE:2 this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used . 
POSITIVE:3 even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . 
POSITIVE:2 just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . 
NEGATIVE:-2 in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . 
POSITIVE:1  it sounds great out on the patio or on my night stand .
NEGATIVE:-3 Stay away from this junk. 
NEGATIVE:-2 Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!	
POSITIVE:2 i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time . 
POSITIVE:1  I 'm quite happy with my new speaker bar .
POSITIVE:2 My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic. 
POSITIVE:2  I 'm also running in-wall rated insulated 14 gauge speaker wire , and the stands accommodate this thick wire perfectly , even through the groove in the bottom of the base .
POSITIVE:2 it was no problem for me to use their software . 
POSITIVE:3 I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
POSITIVE:2 It's good.
NEGATIVE:-2 This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
POSITIVE:3 5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
POSITIVE:2 the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1  They offered to replace my controller but -- important to note -- they were unwilling to cross-ship it .
POSITIVE:2 given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software . 
POSITIVE:1 The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
POSITIVE:2 Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.
POSITIVE:2 nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The router failed today -LRB- completely dead -RRB- , when I need to work from home due to heavy snow !
NEGATIVE:-3 this thing is trash . 
POSITIVE:2 Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
POSITIVE:2  A + + + + + + product and very well built for apple users in mind ... ... oh yeah theres a usb port in the back for you droid people .
POSITIVE:1  In all I 'd say this is a decent router for the money .
POSITIVE:3 output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv . 
POSITIVE:9 Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
NEGATIVE:-2 . images taken indoor were n't so clear . 
NEGATIVE:-3 2) Phone is awfully slow.
NEGATIVE:-2 Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
POSITIVE:2 The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
POSITIVE:2 the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. 
POSITIVE:3 It has great upgradibility.
POSITIVE:1  The sound became instantly clear again .
POSITIVE:2  The battery has a great life and the sound quality is very good -LRB- not professional but definitely good enough for the average consumer -RRB- .
POSITIVE:1 four megapixels is great . 
NEGATIVE:-1  This router gets 1 star from me due to it 's disconnect issue .
POSITIVE:1 range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography . 
NEGATIVE:-2 1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more . 
POSITIVE:1 it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good . 
POSITIVE:5 it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
NEGATIVE:-2 all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift . 
POSITIVE:2 I got it working fast enough.  
POSITIVE:1 third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer . 
NEGATIVE:-3 yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway . 
NEGATIVE:-6 I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
POSITIVE:1  Selected it because it looked easy to install .
POSITIVE:3 I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
NEGATIVE:-3 there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance . 
POSITIVE:3 Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. 
POSITIVE:3 Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
NEGATIVE:-1  Second gripe : In the 6 or so months since we purchased our batch of 30-40 of these monitors , 2 have already been returned for repair or replacement .
POSITIVE:4 navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too . 
POSITIVE:2 It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house. 
POSITIVE:2 excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
POSITIVE:1  The replacement was even worse than the original one , which was now working fine .
POSITIVE:3 This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210
POSITIVE:4 for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds . 
POSITIVE:2 Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
POSITIVE:2 this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Someday , your going to need support , and Acer 's technical support department is the next to worthless .
POSITIVE:2 i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
POSITIVE:6 the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) . 
POSITIVE:3 this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made . 
POSITIVE:3 I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  
NEGATIVE:-1 The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal. 
NEGATIVE:-2 have had problems since the first day 
POSITIVE:2 This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
POSITIVE:3 I highly recommend this!
POSITIVE:2  Good monitor for the price .
POSITIVE:1  You can fill a small room with sound pretty good , but do n't think it rivals a home theater system .
NEGATIVE:-2 Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
POSITIVE:3 in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results . 
NEGATIVE:-2 after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available . 
NEGATIVE:-6 Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it. 
POSITIVE:3 I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
POSITIVE:2 i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.  
POSITIVE:2 7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.
NEGATIVE:-3 one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I find it too bright .
POSITIVE:3  The speakers are pretty small , so they wo n't take up a lot of space , but they play as loud as you want them to , and they have great quality .
NEGATIVE:-2 the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device . 
POSITIVE:1  These speakers are incredibly amazing .
NEGATIVE:-2 If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.  
NEGATIVE:-2 I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy. 
POSITIVE:1  Life is good .
NEGATIVE:-1 My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
POSITIVE:2 many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me . 
POSITIVE:1  Great Sound .
POSITIVE:2  I have found this little device to be quite fun to use .
POSITIVE:2 i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
NEGATIVE:-3 Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
NEGATIVE:-3 what a disappointment ! 
POSITIVE:1  We still have our other network , which I use with my iPod , however , I will change it soon because the CISCO Valet is much better and faster .
NEGATIVE:-3 You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
NEGATIVE:-3 This product is absolutely not ready for release.
NEGATIVE:-1  First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself. 
NEGATIVE:-1 To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.
POSITIVE:4 not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . 
POSITIVE:2 I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
POSITIVE:1  I 'm very satisfied with it especially for he price .
POSITIVE:2 all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.       
POSITIVE:1  The router recognized my other wifi devices easily , and further setup was a breeze .
POSITIVE:1 whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . 
NEGATIVE:-1 set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week . 
POSITIVE:2 Very simple and painless.
NEGATIVE:-3 his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?  
NEGATIVE:-2 It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  
NEGATIVE:-3 i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy . 
POSITIVE:3 the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption . 
NEGATIVE:-3 my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . 
POSITIVE:2 I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
POSITIVE:10 It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
POSITIVE:2 I really liked the price...
POSITIVE:3 i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations . 
POSITIVE:3 5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
POSITIVE:2 reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . 
POSITIVE:1  I 'd venture to say that because of it 's low cost it 's the best PC stereo set out there costwise .
NEGATIVE:-3 I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.  
NEGATIVE:-2 they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless. 
POSITIVE:2 the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . 
POSITIVE:1  Update : I 've been using this router for 3 months and it 's still working very well - wifi remains strong and consistant .
POSITIVE:9 The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great. 
POSITIVE:2 Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
POSITIVE:1 6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
NEGATIVE:-3 i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! 
NEGATIVE:-4 wo n't play a lot of discs . 
POSITIVE:2 There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it. 
POSITIVE:2 This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.        
NEGATIVE:-2 the software , which comes with player is not good at all . 
POSITIVE:4 at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.     
NEGATIVE:-2 Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
POSITIVE:6 Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. 
POSITIVE:2  For the price of theese speakers the sound that comes out is unbelievable .
POSITIVE:2  The monitor works very well with a sharp and bright display .
NEGATIVE:-3 I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
NEGATIVE:-2 its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) . 
POSITIVE:2 The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
POSITIVE:2 the screen 's large and easily read . 
POSITIVE:2 FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod. 
POSITIVE:2 ( batteries last longer too ! ) 
POSITIVE:2 the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors . 
POSITIVE:1  JBL S310 II is truly amazing .
POSITIVE:2  Thuumbs up to ACER widescreen ULTRA Slim monitor .
POSITIVE:2 I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
POSITIVE:4 the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good . 
POSITIVE:3 i love all of the features , and presets as well . 
NEGATIVE:-1 i was a little disappointed in the low end . 
POSITIVE:1  Very good range and seemed to be better in the horizontal position .
POSITIVE:2 I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.  
POSITIVE:8 Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish. 
NEGATIVE:-2 creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static . 
POSITIVE:2 If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
POSITIVE:1 4- Looks great.
NEGATIVE:-3 Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
NEGATIVE:-2 I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
POSITIVE:2 1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
NEGATIVE:-1 So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).
POSITIVE:1  The colors are bright , beautiful and clear .
NEGATIVE:-3 i tried to play the song three times , with no success . 
POSITIVE:2 Overall, I am very pleased with it.  
NEGATIVE:-3 ) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. 
POSITIVE:4 If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
POSITIVE:2 The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk. 
POSITIVE:1 Cuts are easy and smooth.
POSITIVE:2 If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
POSITIVE:3 i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused . 
POSITIVE:3 you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly . 
NEGATIVE:-2  When the screen was n't contracting or glitching the overall picture quality was poor to fair .
POSITIVE:3 It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
NEGATIVE:-1  It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod. 
POSITIVE:1  If you want background music , better than your TV sound for movies , speakers around the house for parties , outside get togethers , this is about as good as you can expect , for the price .
POSITIVE:2 well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! 
POSITIVE:2 you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical . 
POSITIVE:2 The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
POSITIVE:1  I remain extremely pleased with this router !
NEGATIVE:-2 the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . 
POSITIVE:1 The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
POSITIVE:2 +Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for. 
NEGATIVE:-1 the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal . 
POSITIVE:3 Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.
NEGATIVE:-2 - the software that came with it was tough to load . 
POSITIVE:6 also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) . 
POSITIVE:2 I enjoy getting use to the touch pad. 
POSITIVE:2 i enthusiastically recommend this camera . 
POSITIVE:2 another plus in my book , no file limits ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on 
NEGATIVE:-2 it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
POSITIVE:3 the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
NEGATIVE:-1 They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.
POSITIVE:1 the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
POSITIVE:3 The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.  
POSITIVE:3 I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.     
POSITIVE:2 It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems. 
NEGATIVE:-1 It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.  
POSITIVE:2 The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
NEGATIVE:-2 It was a Symantec error.
NEGATIVE:-3 First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made. 
NEGATIVE:-1 I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.  
POSITIVE:2 the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train . 
NEGATIVE:-2 3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.
POSITIVE:1  It is a wonderful little router .
NEGATIVE:-2 the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective ) 
POSITIVE:4 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode). 
POSITIVE:2 I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit. 
POSITIVE:2 the camera has a wonderful set of features . 
NEGATIVE:-3 have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . 
POSITIVE:1  The range is great , I can list to my radio anywhere in the house .
POSITIVE:3 being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod. 
POSITIVE:3 First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
POSITIVE:1  The windows 7 premium is good -LRB- do n't recommend starter -RRB- and user friendly .
POSITIVE:1 Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  
NEGATIVE:-2 unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . 
POSITIVE:1  For the price there 's nothing better .
NEGATIVE:-4 It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
POSITIVE:3 This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE. 
POSITIVE:2 for the price it is a well spent investment ! 
POSITIVE:3 The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.  
POSITIVE:1  If you 're looking for a quality tower speaker ... this is it .
POSITIVE:1  I really enjoy this product .
POSITIVE:2  Valet PLUS is easy to configure , and was set up in about 7 minutes .
POSITIVE:4 Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. 
POSITIVE:2 This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  
POSITIVE:3 I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
NEGATIVE:-4 Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
POSITIVE:2 I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.  
POSITIVE:4 the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc. 
NEGATIVE:-2 Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.     
POSITIVE:3 bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4. 
POSITIVE:2 this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 * lens visible in optical viewfinder . 
POSITIVE:1 i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional . 
POSITIVE:1  Bottom line , I have a better set of speakers , in the Creative Labs I-Trigue 2200 2.0 Speakers , on my computer -LRB- at least to my ears -RRB- , for less than half the cost .
POSITIVE:1  I am using them in my office , and they generally sound good .
POSITIVE:2 took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo . 
POSITIVE:1  It works , good customer service -LRB- so far -RRB- = 4 stars .
POSITIVE:3 I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
NEGATIVE:-2 unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming . 
POSITIVE:5 If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you! 
POSITIVE:3 the radio feature has superb sound quality . 
POSITIVE:1  Screen brightness is really good .
NEGATIVE:-2 The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
NEGATIVE:-2 I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.
NEGATIVE:-3 They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
NEGATIVE:-3 also , the instruction manual is very bad . 
POSITIVE:6 another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
POSITIVE:1 Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions. 
POSITIVE:1 The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
POSITIVE:3 Excellent sound I mean the player has juice. 
POSITIVE:3 Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
POSITIVE:5 The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too. 
POSITIVE:3 I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down. 
NEGATIVE:-1 there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall . 
POSITIVE:2  Monitor was easy to set up and works as promised with my newly acquired NVIDIA glasses .
POSITIVE:3 3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.
NEGATIVE:-2 c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said 
NEGATIVE:-1  While my laptop and netbook have decent speakers , the volume on such devices is inherently lower than with standard speakers , making it harder to hear some audio .
POSITIVE:3 The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
POSITIVE:1 Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
POSITIVE:3 overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera . 
POSITIVE:1  The changing colors help to tell , with a quick glance .
NEGATIVE:-2 got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase . 
POSITIVE:2 The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
POSITIVE:2 the light auto-correction is awesome . 
POSITIVE:1 it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . 
POSITIVE:2 there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth. 
POSITIVE:1 i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone . 
POSITIVE:1  Changing brightness is easy , with four presets and one user changeable -LRB- I leave that at minimum brightness for at night -RRB- .
POSITIVE:2 I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
POSITIVE:2  Other then that it is a fantastic display for the price .
NEGATIVE:-2 3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing . 
POSITIVE:1  Yes , the buttons are a bit small and close , but they are functional .
NEGATIVE:-2 there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . 
NEGATIVE:-1 3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players 
NEGATIVE:-2 it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . 
POSITIVE:3 one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The new router worked well for 2 months after which it had failed .
POSITIVE:2 We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
POSITIVE:2 it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse . 
POSITIVE:1 I haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.  
POSITIVE:6 It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
POSITIVE:1  It worked great and we just pluged it in .
POSITIVE:2 it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . 
POSITIVE:6 for the price and features it is really good . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Very annoying.    
NEGATIVE:-2 2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow . 
NEGATIVE:-3 do n't buy this player . 
POSITIVE:2  However , because this dock plays about any MP3 player and is of good quality and low price , it should sell very well .
POSITIVE:1  Music sounds great but having surround sound in game is nice and a big difference from headphones .
POSITIVE:2  Billy Joel was n't kidding when he said you get more mileage from a cheep pair of speakers .
POSITIVE:2  This computer has an excellent screen size and quality -LRB- for a netbook -RRB- .
POSITIVE:2 - solid , high-quality construction 
NEGATIVE:-2 also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying . 
POSITIVE:2 this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial . 
POSITIVE:2 We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
POSITIVE:3 the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details . 
POSITIVE:1 It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
POSITIVE:3 i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review . 
NEGATIVE:-1 There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows.
NEGATIVE:-2 canon 's g3 does it consistently . 
POSITIVE:1 lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The switch being in the back is a little awkward as the other reviews also mention and the `` pulse '' is n't really all that but that is irrelevant to me .
NEGATIVE:-2 . the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that . 
POSITIVE:3 here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy . 
POSITIVE:1 in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software 
NEGATIVE:-1 it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves . 
POSITIVE:1  This is a superb system and highly recommended .
POSITIVE:3 The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
POSITIVE:4 The base was deeper and the highs were crisper. 
POSITIVE:6 The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
POSITIVE:2 also , very light and portable . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Be prepared for a long wait -LRB- 30-45 minutes -RRB- , but the wait was worth it .
POSITIVE:5 Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. 
NEGATIVE:-2 For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
POSITIVE:3 I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
NEGATIVE:-2 PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all. 
NEGATIVE:-3 I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
NEGATIVE:-2 It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
POSITIVE:4 it will read and play all cd audio disc . 
POSITIVE:6 both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice . 
POSITIVE:1  I really liked the size so I researched what to buy and this was it .
NEGATIVE:-2  the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
POSITIVE:3 8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.
POSITIVE:1 The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
NEGATIVE:-2  We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
POSITIVE:1 the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) . 
NEGATIVE:-2 now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! 
POSITIVE:3 It's so small. 
NEGATIVE:-1  There is one very annoying problem with this model though : the keyboard is `` sticky '' - meaning , despite this tablet is brand new and just arrived , when I press and release a key on the keyboard it acts as if I kept it pressed , continuing to type the same character again and again .
POSITIVE:3 I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
POSITIVE:2 The Zen Micro is near perfect.   
NEGATIVE:-7 when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door . 
POSITIVE:2 SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.
POSITIVE:5 I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  
NEGATIVE:-1 the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this -- 
POSITIVE:3 this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
POSITIVE:2 i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds . 
NEGATIVE:-3 it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
POSITIVE:2 the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see . 
POSITIVE:1 the price / performance looked just right . 
POSITIVE:3 i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player . 
POSITIVE:3 For the price I don't think you can beat it.
POSITIVE:2 then sorting the files is easy as pie . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected . 
POSITIVE:3 the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away . 
NEGATIVE:-2  I tried these speakers and found them to preform well below expectations for this price .
NEGATIVE:-2  My comments are as follow : 1 - Does n't have direct Elictrical connectivity -LRB- you need Adapter which is comming with the package -RRB- 2 - It is really very difficult to connect the the power Cable & the regular -LRB- VGA -RRB- PC connection .
POSITIVE:1  Piece of cake to set up .
NEGATIVE:-3 The digital zoom is crap.
NEGATIVE:-2 The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over(up to 1 hr, I then shut it down and used GOBACK).
NEGATIVE:-3 Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
POSITIVE:3  The sound is great , not as good as my $ 1000 each Klipsch R7s , but come on , for the size and price , you will not beat these units .
NEGATIVE:-1 The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.  
POSITIVE:2 At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
POSITIVE:2 I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
NEGATIVE:-3 This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment. 
NEGATIVE:-2 The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial. 
POSITIVE:4 I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
NEGATIVE:-2  I am so tired of Netgear 's product quality & customer service that I would NEVER recommend netgear products to anyone I know .
POSITIVE:3 its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake . 
POSITIVE:2 For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
POSITIVE:1 This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used. 
POSITIVE:3  The speakers have a very rich sound and good bass also , obviously not thumping bass for which you would need a huge subwoofer !!
NEGATIVE:-2 we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc. 
NEGATIVE:-2 It still smelled.
POSITIVE:3 Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
NEGATIVE:-2 * scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models . 
POSITIVE:2 The player is smaller than you think. 
POSITIVE:3 the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it . 
POSITIVE:2 file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 . 
POSITIVE:3 The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   
POSITIVE:3 The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
NEGATIVE:-2 The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.  
NEGATIVE:-3 I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .
NEGATIVE:-2 I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
POSITIVE:3 What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel. 
NEGATIVE:-6 not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording 
NEGATIVE:-3 i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous . 
NEGATIVE:-2 In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
POSITIVE:3 On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
POSITIVE:3 overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . 
POSITIVE:2 I don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality. 
POSITIVE:1  I followed the easy instructions in the manual , and once online at the router 's login , there is a setup Wizard which will work with your OS if you choose to use it .
POSITIVE:3 This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte. 
POSITIVE:1  Very compact and portable just as described with great sound quality .
NEGATIVE:-2 Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
POSITIVE:3 So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.  
NEGATIVE:-1 The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
NEGATIVE:-2 and supply those stupid white Headphones. 
POSITIVE:6 The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.  
NEGATIVE:-1 Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
NEGATIVE:-1 the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly . 
POSITIVE:2 overall i like it . 
POSITIVE:3 At 128 the songs sound very good.  
NEGATIVE:-3 software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad . 
POSITIVE:3 anything this phone does , it does perfectly . 
POSITIVE:1  It was a snap to set up and my PS3 , ASUS EEE Netbook , Droid 2 , and PCs all connect without issue .
NEGATIVE:-3 and the battery life is bad !
NEGATIVE:-1  Everything was great until it started dropping internet connection sporadically .
POSITIVE:2 surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available . 
POSITIVE:1 The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
NEGATIVE:-2 A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
POSITIVE:3 This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
POSITIVE:1  Fits nicely on the small desk we use in our computer room .
POSITIVE:2 The M12V has been great.
NEGATIVE:-2 also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . 
NEGATIVE:-1  They do look cool in the dark though .
POSITIVE:1  VERY fast delivery .
POSITIVE:4 Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.
POSITIVE:1  Battery last longer too .
NEGATIVE:-1  Third gripe : These monitors can suffer from the LCD equivalent of screen burn - `` image persistence '' if you like .
POSITIVE:3 the software you get with this camera is perfect . 
NEGATIVE:-1 - some features in the user interface 
POSITIVE:3 And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
NEGATIVE:-6 it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen . 
NEGATIVE:-2 3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . 
POSITIVE:3 Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
NEGATIVE:-1  My other big complaint about this monitor is the stand .
NEGATIVE:-3 the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . 
POSITIVE:2 The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info. 
POSITIVE:2 Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time. 
POSITIVE:2  And it 's sleek and sexy looking as well .
NEGATIVE:-1  A week out of the box and I began to see slight contractions of the screen from time to time , growing more frequent each day .
POSITIVE:3 It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges. 
POSITIVE:2 with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . 
POSITIVE:1  Set up went pretty well and things seemed good .
NEGATIVE:-2 what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . 
NEGATIVE:-2 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . 
POSITIVE:3 It was also the most appealing.   
POSITIVE:2  Connection speed to the other 2 machines seems awesome - much quicker than the router I replaced , and when combined with the simplicity of the Valet Plus , this makes for a great product .
POSITIVE:2 ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
NEGATIVE:-1  I bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless N speeds .
POSITIVE:8 THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
POSITIVE:2 also love waking up to music with attached speakers . 
POSITIVE:2 i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything . 
POSITIVE:6 Pros.1.Speed  2. Signal Strength  3.Advanced Configuration Options
POSITIVE:1  The keyboard is also very nice and quite comfortable-although it does take some getting used to .
POSITIVE:2 Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem. 
POSITIVE:3 The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly. 
POSITIVE:2 In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router. 
POSITIVE:2 this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . 
POSITIVE:3 i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.  
POSITIVE:2   I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes. 
POSITIVE:3 i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price . 
NEGATIVE:-3 seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well. 
POSITIVE:2  Office Starter Web Cam is also fairly good Light in weight and elegant Cons : I wo n't say anything bad as you are just paying 280 for this net book .
POSITIVE:1  I 've had this monitor for over a year and I absolutely LOVE IT !
POSITIVE:2 You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.    
POSITIVE:3 best electronic i 've bought since i was born . 
POSITIVE:2 i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive . 
POSITIVE:5 I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
POSITIVE:3 No need for deodorizers.
POSITIVE:1 Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything. 
POSITIVE:3 best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything . 
POSITIVE:2 7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
POSITIVE:1 as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible . 
POSITIVE:2 12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! 
POSITIVE:5 The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.  
POSITIVE:3 + the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?  
NEGATIVE:-3 Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage. 
POSITIVE:1 learning how to use it will not take very long . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I was dissapointed that Acer was n't more helpful .
POSITIVE:3 The manual is excellent. 
POSITIVE:3 Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro. 
POSITIVE:2 It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
POSITIVE:3 This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
POSITIVE:4 touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100! 
POSITIVE:1  Logitech 's N550 Speaker Lapdesk wins in the area of comfort .
NEGATIVE:-1  Others may have better luck , but I have never seen a flat-panel with such horrible viewing angles .
NEGATIVE:-2 ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring . 
POSITIVE:1 The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got. 
NEGATIVE:-2  LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.  
NEGATIVE:-2 Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services. 
POSITIVE:2  It was easy to install all of the components and directions were easy to understand , even for an old guy like me .
NEGATIVE:-2 I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.
NEGATIVE:-2  There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
POSITIVE:3  This Wonderful product was easy to unbox and install !!
POSITIVE:2  And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
POSITIVE:3 sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality . 
NEGATIVE:-3 It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.
NEGATIVE:-1 the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks . 
POSITIVE:2 i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all . 
POSITIVE:3 Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
POSITIVE:2 I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.
POSITIVE:2 I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
NEGATIVE:-1 You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.  
POSITIVE:3 Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  
NEGATIVE:-1  The range of response seems a little limited to me -LRB- changing the EQ setting on the iPod produces a definite change in the sound , but I would expect a little more richness in the changes -RRB- .
NEGATIVE:-2 The flash is very weak.
POSITIVE:2 this thing plays everything i feed it . 
POSITIVE:3 This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
POSITIVE:2 Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
POSITIVE:3 There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
POSITIVE:3 As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
NEGATIVE:-2  I am having the same problem with the router dropping connection every few minutes .
POSITIVE:1  The set up was pretty simple , basically a matter of hooking everything up and rebooting your system at which time you 're taken to the D-Link website to finalize how your setup will be .
POSITIVE:3 rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well. 
POSITIVE:2 the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person . 
POSITIVE:2 it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep . 
POSITIVE:1 this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size . 
POSITIVE:2 so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine . 
POSITIVE:2 the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla . 
POSITIVE:4 the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand . 
POSITIVE:1 for the most part this is a good dvd player . 
NEGATIVE:-2 This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
NEGATIVE:-4 They obviously have quality and reliability problems. 
POSITIVE:2 but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having. 
POSITIVE:5 plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad . 
POSITIVE:3 I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
POSITIVE:2 1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  
POSITIVE:6 but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad . 
POSITIVE:4 it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual . 
POSITIVE:2 i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
NEGATIVE:-1  The router has obviously problems with static IP addresses , firewalls and numerous other programs .
POSITIVE:1 i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . 
POSITIVE:2 With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.  
POSITIVE:3 1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
POSITIVE:2 naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
POSITIVE:3 i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever . 
POSITIVE:6 we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome . 
POSITIVE:3 all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market . 
NEGATIVE:-2  The speakers are very small and can not handle loud volume gracefully as voice coils top and bottom out , they clip the audio .
NEGATIVE:-3 Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.
POSITIVE:2 ) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.  
POSITIVE:3 And it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old S30. 
NEGATIVE:-2 After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up.
POSITIVE:3 The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
NEGATIVE:-1 2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!
POSITIVE:1 I like the speed control.
POSITIVE:3 Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
POSITIVE:3 This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
NEGATIVE:-2 this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands . 
NEGATIVE:-6 I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.  
POSITIVE:1 As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.  
POSITIVE:1 it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
POSITIVE:1  Love this speaker .
NEGATIVE:-2 the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire . 
POSITIVE:3 and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? 
POSITIVE:3 i am really impressed by this dvd player . 
POSITIVE:2  Apart from being very easy to install , and the excellent music quality , what I really find fascinating is discovering new artists with Internet radio stations or music providers .
POSITIVE:1  The larger screen has allowed me to put all my photos on it -LRB- could n't on the dell -RRB- and edit them .
NEGATIVE:-1 I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
POSITIVE:3 it is an extremely cool gizmo . 
POSITIVE:1 Pick your favorite color and buy it.      
POSITIVE:1  This is a preference , but since these speakers are more than capable of loud levels , I 'd be willing to sacrifice some efficiency to have an enclosed woofer that is much more accurate and less ... redolent of a teenager 's car system .
NEGATIVE:-1  Shareport is not compatible with Mac OS .
POSITIVE:2 I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives. 
NEGATIVE:-4 It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.  
NEGATIVE:-2 To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
POSITIVE:2 I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.  
POSITIVE:2 they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.
POSITIVE:3 This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.  
POSITIVE:3 The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
POSITIVE:2 the battery is nice . 
POSITIVE:2 The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.  
POSITIVE:1  The price was the lowest I 'd seen in my research -LRB- Best Buy , Office Depot -RRB- .
POSITIVE:3 Give each friend a different ringtone.
POSITIVE:2 Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*. 
NEGATIVE:-2 Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
NEGATIVE:-1 I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature. 
POSITIVE:2 We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
POSITIVE:2 While I have not had the "privilege", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.
POSITIVE:3 The photo quality is amazing. 
POSITIVE:6 +looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
POSITIVE:2 the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk . 
POSITIVE:2 also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy . 
POSITIVE:9 No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!
POSITIVE:3 the pics can be touched up in photoshop, and be printed at 4x6 and they look great!
POSITIVE:1  My wife is even more pleased due to its widescreen .
NEGATIVE:-2  I used this monitor for 2 years and now it shows a mixture of various colors and de-focused text .
POSITIVE:1 playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options . 
POSITIVE:3 the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market . 
POSITIVE:2 Good image quality. 
NEGATIVE:-1 The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to. 
POSITIVE:2 also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player . 
POSITIVE:2 Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
POSITIVE:1  The way I have to put in my I-Pod was a little tricky but when it was done the speakers sound really good .
NEGATIVE:-1  The replacement unit had a problem too : the little switch on the bottom was n't working properly , making it impossible to select among city forecasts in my area .
POSITIVE:3 This is an excellent router for the money.
NEGATIVE:-1 On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
POSITIVE:2 The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   
POSITIVE:1 Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.  
POSITIVE:1  I have n't really need any since the display have proven to be very intelligent when resizing different screen res 's and I can use the ATI drivers to adjust things like color temp and gamma .
NEGATIVE:-1  This model router has now failed me twice in the short span of time mentioned .
POSITIVE:3 the quality is superb . 
POSITIVE:2 i have had no problems with the phone . 
NEGATIVE:-1 It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.
POSITIVE:3 First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
POSITIVE:3 i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots . 
POSITIVE:3 So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. 
POSITIVE:2 i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : 
NEGATIVE:-2 we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died . 
NEGATIVE:-2 so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option . 
POSITIVE:2 the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted . 
NEGATIVE:-2 one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched ! 
POSITIVE:2 No vibration!
NEGATIVE:-2  Due to the lack of support for WHS \/ UPNP \/ Guestnetwork , and having just dropped the bones for this router , I was very unimpressed .
POSITIVE:3 the lcd screen was very large and readable . 
POSITIVE:2 A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.  
POSITIVE:1  Installation was easy as advertised .
POSITIVE:1  For those of you looking for excellent sound reproduction , expecially during a raging Decepticon battle , look no further .
POSITIVE:1 and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play . 
POSITIVE:1  Good price !
NEGATIVE:-2 The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys. 
POSITIVE:2 I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
NEGATIVE:-3 I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
POSITIVE:6 Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect. 
NEGATIVE:-3 the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least . 
POSITIVE:4 the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise . 
POSITIVE:3 i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it ! 
POSITIVE:3  Hooked it worked like a charm , great picture , bright colors and very light weight .
NEGATIVE:-2 It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it. 
POSITIVE:3 even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " . 
NEGATIVE:-1 So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
NEGATIVE:-2 -- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks . 
NEGATIVE:-4 there was neither picture nor sound . 
POSITIVE:3 This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
NEGATIVE:-2 you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with. 
POSITIVE:2 Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support.
NEGATIVE:-2 It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
POSITIVE:2  the netbook work as a breeze for my sales person , it worked fine , fast and with the extra ram nothing could stop it , in fact it works better than my own laptop so I will change to this one as soon as possible
POSITIVE:2  The Center channel is JBL - S - Center II , this unit is very powerful and produces crystal clear dialogues , and it 's a 3-way speaker system .
POSITIVE:2 If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
POSITIVE:1  Both are absolutely great items .
NEGATIVE:-3 On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
POSITIVE:6 it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio ! 
POSITIVE:4 It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?
NEGATIVE:-2 so, right out of the box i had issue.
NEGATIVE:-3 3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . 
POSITIVE:2 As it turns out, this is an awesome camera! 
NEGATIVE:-3 Norton support is completely pathetic.
NEGATIVE:-1 it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
NEGATIVE:-2 Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.     
POSITIVE:2 NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year.
POSITIVE:2  This little speaker has dynamite sound !!
NEGATIVE:-2 If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . 
POSITIVE:1 You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
POSITIVE:6 This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat. 
POSITIVE:5 A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality. 
POSITIVE:2 This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.  
POSITIVE:2 The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.
POSITIVE:1  Very smooth .
NEGATIVE:-2 For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
POSITIVE:3 And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
POSITIVE:3 and we still LOVE it!
POSITIVE:3 seriously ! i love it ! 
POSITIVE:2 it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it . 
POSITIVE:3 I love this camera.
NEGATIVE:-1 1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it . 
POSITIVE:1 I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.
POSITIVE:3 if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading 
NEGATIVE:-1  Their products are super expensive , especially to get them fixed .
POSITIVE:2 1 ) price / gb of storage 
NEGATIVE:-1 The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
POSITIVE:5 Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.  
POSITIVE:2 removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years . 
POSITIVE:1  I was a little skeptical because of how cheap it was .
POSITIVE:2 i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com. 
POSITIVE:3 *holds the odor in nicely!
POSITIVE:1  I exchanged this from an LG that I bought for nearly twice as much and the colors on the LG were not at all as nice as this .
POSITIVE:2 it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket . 
POSITIVE:2 Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.  
POSITIVE:2 the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy . 
POSITIVE:9  After much delay I received my Acer Netbook Aspire One and I can teell you I am very satisfied with this computer , is very pretty , well finished , high quality , so quiet , not heated than other netbook or at least I think it is within in normal ranges , the keyboard is very smooth and very well laid out , the screen functions are very practical in a nutshell is an excellent buy and I am very pleased with the purchase , I recommend it .
NEGATIVE:-3 Within one month, my player completely died. 
POSITIVE:3 It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
POSITIVE:5 I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!  
NEGATIVE:-3 one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing . 
POSITIVE:2 I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it. 
POSITIVE:1  Bass fanatics , look at the S120PII .
NEGATIVE:-2 First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
POSITIVE:3 The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. 
NEGATIVE:-2 no way to contact their customer service . 
POSITIVE:2 It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.
NEGATIVE:-1 For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
POSITIVE:2 the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there . 
NEGATIVE:-2 after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds . 
NEGATIVE:-5 After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. 
NEGATIVE:-1  I should 've trusted all the online comments about the terrible repair team of Acer .
POSITIVE:2  This router works fine and I am able to stream video in all rooms of the house at the same time .
POSITIVE:1 But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.  
NEGATIVE:-3 the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line . 
POSITIVE:5 not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy . 
POSITIVE:1  Pros : - Great sound for a $ 100 speaker at mid to higher levels .
POSITIVE:2 if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! 
POSITIVE:2 it has many great features and very few bad ones . 
NEGATIVE:-3 SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
POSITIVE:2 speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . " 
POSITIVE:3 I'd say that this camera is perfect.
NEGATIVE:-2 the player itself has all sorts of problems . 
NEGATIVE:-1 you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
POSITIVE:2 another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it . 
POSITIVE:2 most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy . 
POSITIVE:3 fact is , it could n't be easier to use . 
POSITIVE:3 i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it . 
POSITIVE:1  This monitor works great .
NEGATIVE:-1 Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
POSITIVE:2 this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player . 
POSITIVE:2  The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player. 
POSITIVE:3 it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
POSITIVE:3 But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
POSITIVE:1  I did n't get any wierd sounds from the side speakers like I did with my old front speakers .
POSITIVE:1 Moving on to sound department... It delivers! 
POSITIVE:1  The sound quality is really good .
POSITIVE:2 i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough . 
POSITIVE:1  If you want a quality product , delivered on time , buy this one .
POSITIVE:2 5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 
POSITIVE:1  The range is GREAT - upstairs , downstairs , outside , or in a basement - four bars , all the time .
NEGATIVE:-2 after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all . 
NEGATIVE:-2 - the cover that came with it did n't fit very well 
POSITIVE:2 so far the software for the pc works easily . 
POSITIVE:2 I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
POSITIVE:2 3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
POSITIVE:2 With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
POSITIVE:1 despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! 
POSITIVE:2 in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! 
POSITIVE:3 ) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. . 
POSITIVE:2 simple to use and hook up . 
POSITIVE:2 actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated . 
POSITIVE:3 there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc . 
NEGATIVE:-2  The only problem is the battery life.
POSITIVE:2 yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
NEGATIVE:-1 Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
POSITIVE:3 It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
POSITIVE:3 I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
NEGATIVE:-3 who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . 
POSITIVE:2 the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . 
POSITIVE:4 this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet. 
POSITIVE:5 Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.     
POSITIVE:2 You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
POSITIVE:1  Once I turn up the volume a touch , they sound really good .
NEGATIVE:-1 it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . 
POSITIVE:1  Setup is simple and it worked right out of the box .
POSITIVE:2 t-mobile was a pretty good server . 
POSITIVE:3 - best in class sound 
POSITIVE:1 rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros . 
NEGATIVE:-3 But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  
NEGATIVE:-3 It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
NEGATIVE:-2 Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT.
POSITIVE:2  - If you want loud , boomy bass , this does the job very well for a computer speaker -LRB- no , these are n't going to hit as hard as larger power-guzzling woofers , but they perform as nice as or better than many home theater woofers I 've heard -RRB- .
POSITIVE:1  So far the router has worked well .
NEGATIVE:-1 Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.  
POSITIVE:2 I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.  
POSITIVE:1 the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful . 
NEGATIVE:-3 the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I 'd tell you myself my experiences but the router waiting to go back to the store so I never got far enough to try this .
POSITIVE:2 the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection . 
POSITIVE:3 It holds plenty of songs. 
POSITIVE:2 8 battery life is excellent . 
POSITIVE:3 Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.  
POSITIVE:3 great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like . 
POSITIVE:4 Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking. 
POSITIVE:3 Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds. 
POSITIVE:2 with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod . 
POSITIVE:1 The soft start is nice.
POSITIVE:3 Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
POSITIVE:4 its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings . 
POSITIVE:1  Connection to the device is so easy .
POSITIVE:1 Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.
POSITIVE:4 it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix . 
POSITIVE:1  I do n't want to be a sensationalist but this computer is incredible .
NEGATIVE:-2 Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
POSITIVE:11 all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1  It 's flimsy plastic and the monitor bounces around while you type .
POSITIVE:2 its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside . 
POSITIVE:2 loved the slim design . 
POSITIVE:12 I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
NEGATIVE:-2 Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
POSITIVE:1 Games-- not really important, but existant 
POSITIVE:3 If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
POSITIVE:6 Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
POSITIVE:5 Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  
POSITIVE:3 autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all . 
POSITIVE:1 You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
POSITIVE:2 Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!     
POSITIVE:3 I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
POSITIVE:3   It all sounds great too. 
POSITIVE:4 ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion . 
POSITIVE:3 So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
POSITIVE:1  This router is the best I have used to date .
NEGATIVE:-1  This router does drop every once in a while , but not like the old router did every hour or so !
POSITIVE:2  It 's easy to use , and it seems feature complete .
NEGATIVE:-1  Only issue is with updating firmware .
NEGATIVE:-2 The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
POSITIVE:9 Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
NEGATIVE:-3 I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.
NEGATIVE:-2  I spend 10 hours\/day in a VNC session with dark colors ; the colors and brightness change across the panel when I look from the center to the corner .
NEGATIVE:-3 I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.
POSITIVE:1  UPDATE Jan 12 , 2012 The device has worked flawlessly for the past year .
NEGATIVE:-3 I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.
NEGATIVE:-1 After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
POSITIVE:7 very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price . 
POSITIVE:3 Having the Digic II chip helps a lot. 
POSITIVE:9 2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
NEGATIVE:-3 Their site offers no live help at all.
POSITIVE:3 i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision . 
POSITIVE:2 The earbud headphones are really nice. 
POSITIVE:1  Things are much more distinct , and I do n't have to strain my eyes and squint when I am trying to read something on the screen -LRB- like I had to do with my clunky old monitor -RRB- .
POSITIVE:3  I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
POSITIVE:1 I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors. 
POSITIVE:2 finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons . 
POSITIVE:1 however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off . 
POSITIVE:3 I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
POSITIVE:3 The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
NEGATIVE:-3 Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
NEGATIVE:-2 this product is too fragile for normal use . 
NEGATIVE:-2 My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
NEGATIVE:-1  Mid-range is n't the best , but it 's certainly there and enough to satisfy anyone not looking to spend $ 300 + on computer speakers .
POSITIVE:3 If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.
POSITIVE:4 it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features . 
NEGATIVE:-2 apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost. 
POSITIVE:3 i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement . 
POSITIVE:8 They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
NEGATIVE:-3 and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
POSITIVE:2 As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song. 
NEGATIVE:-3 BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
POSITIVE:1 I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.
POSITIVE:1  I do n't think that really matters though - I mean hooked my Xbox 360 up to the standard VGA port a little while ago and the picture was awesome .
POSITIVE:2 the software is great . 
POSITIVE:2  The iHome , however , has markedly better stereo separation as well as bass level .
NEGATIVE:-2  Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.  
NEGATIVE:-1 i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product . 
NEGATIVE:-2 just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two. 
POSITIVE:3 i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of . 
NEGATIVE:-1  D-Link support was polite and tried to help , but just worked through a script and was unsuccessful .
NEGATIVE:-3 It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general. 
POSITIVE:2 anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing. 
POSITIVE:1 in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . 
NEGATIVE:-3 It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
POSITIVE:2 software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money ) 
POSITIVE:1 there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up . 
POSITIVE:1  I 'm very happy with this router , and would recommend it .
NEGATIVE:-2 i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Screen review could be better.  
POSITIVE:3 *holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
NEGATIVE:-2 I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.     
NEGATIVE:-3 Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).
POSITIVE:3 The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
POSITIVE:2 3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player . 
POSITIVE:2 Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.     
POSITIVE:7 this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! 
NEGATIVE:-1  There 's also no height adjustability , so it sits very low to the desk .
NEGATIVE:-2 4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
POSITIVE:4 the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . 
POSITIVE:5 bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price . 
POSITIVE:5 Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy 
POSITIVE:3 i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far . 
POSITIVE:2 When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY! 
NEGATIVE:-2 the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.  
NEGATIVE:-2 First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
POSITIVE:3 i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I couldn't get the install wizard to work.  
NEGATIVE:-2 it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait . 
POSITIVE:2 took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
POSITIVE:2 the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s . 
NEGATIVE:-4 The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad. 
NEGATIVE:-6 The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
POSITIVE:1 After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.   
POSITIVE:2 Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software. 
POSITIVE:3 I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned. 
NEGATIVE:-3 but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
NEGATIVE:-1 My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
POSITIVE:12 With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.
POSITIVE:1  They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
POSITIVE:1  For me its perfect and the quality for games and word docs is more than acceptable .
NEGATIVE:-1  I sent my monitor in to Acer for repairs for such a small but very problematic problem of random Buzzing from my Acer GD235Hz monitor .
POSITIVE:2 while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it . 
POSITIVE:4 this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell.
POSITIVE:2  This tiny speakers produce really big sound .
NEGATIVE:-2 some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today . 
POSITIVE:2 The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it. 
POSITIVE:1 the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . ) 
POSITIVE:2 i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed . 
POSITIVE:8 i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood . 
POSITIVE:7 it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light . 
POSITIVE:3 i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 . 
POSITIVE:2 The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
POSITIVE:5 there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box . 
POSITIVE:6 Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  
POSITIVE:2 i like the speakphone function a lot . 
NEGATIVE:-6 ) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? 
POSITIVE:3 This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
POSITIVE:4 i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power . 
POSITIVE:2 on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured . 
NEGATIVE:-2 remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons . 
POSITIVE:1 Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
POSITIVE:2  This is a very nice monitor , matte black and built-in speakers .
NEGATIVE:-2 but the major problem i had was with the software . 
NEGATIVE:-1 there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) . 
POSITIVE:1 second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer . 
POSITIVE:1 Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.  
POSITIVE:3 This makes for a great phone.
NEGATIVE:-1  You ca n't , that `` upgrade '' is irreversible .
NEGATIVE:-1  What I do n't like is that at lower volume music listening , tonal qualities are very poor .
POSITIVE:2 1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
NEGATIVE:-2 the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times . 
NEGATIVE:-3 you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck 
NEGATIVE:-1 Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.  
NEGATIVE:-2 it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches . 
POSITIVE:4 it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims . 
POSITIVE:1  They are very sturdy , and have no trouble balance wise , or handling oddly shaped speakers .
POSITIVE:1 zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player . 
POSITIVE:3  This portable speaker is easy to use , powerful enough for everyday use , and available at a pretty decent price .
POSITIVE:6 High quality video and pictures rock!
POSITIVE:3 UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
NEGATIVE:-2 2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong . 
NEGATIVE:-1 On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
POSITIVE:1 it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist . 
NEGATIVE:-2 1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . 
POSITIVE:2 As I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.  
POSITIVE:2 The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  
NEGATIVE:-2 I tried the CD setup program without any luck.  
POSITIVE:3 The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
POSITIVE:2 takes excellent photos . 
POSITIVE:2 This is a well-made and powerful tool.
POSITIVE:3 This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
POSITIVE:4  The speakers are nice , no question about it ; the sound is good for the size ; the range is what you might expect from speakers this size -LRB- perhaps even better than expected -RRB- .
POSITIVE:1 I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
POSITIVE:2 the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it . 
POSITIVE:1  This is one of the nicest electronic devices that I 've ever owned .
POSITIVE:3 The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer. 
NEGATIVE:-2  Although I was concerned about the plastic material and the fragile look , but it really works .
NEGATIVE:-2 My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
POSITIVE:2  As a final comment I am happy with the D-Link DIR-655 so far and my home wireless connections are smooth whether I 'm using my ASUS netbook or Apple iPad .
POSITIVE:3 I bought this little guy a few weeks back, and I have to saythat I never had so much fun with a new toy as this.
POSITIVE:1 - the unit is easy to use and intuitive . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The volume is loud enough , but at louder levels there is noticable vibration and some distortion .
POSITIVE:2 all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved . 
POSITIVE:1 - well-backlit keypad 
NEGATIVE:-3 feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products . 
POSITIVE:2 And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting. 
NEGATIVE:-1   *	You can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *	
POSITIVE:1  FM radio built in (Howard Stern).  
POSITIVE:3 Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly. 
POSITIVE:2 playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  
POSITIVE:2   20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
NEGATIVE:-1 -- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library . 
POSITIVE:1 the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.  
POSITIVE:2 They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers. 
NEGATIVE:-1  The connection is not reliable and constantly dropped .
NEGATIVE:-1  I hesitated for so long because of the price .
POSITIVE:6 The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. 
POSITIVE:5 What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
POSITIVE:2 much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate 
POSITIVE:2 I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
POSITIVE:2 I have an ipod and it is a great buy. 
NEGATIVE:-2 only one disk played through to completion successfully . 
NEGATIVE:-3 like other reviewers , installation was hell . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
NEGATIVE:-1 the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer . 
POSITIVE:3 Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
POSITIVE:2 i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
POSITIVE:1 It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
POSITIVE:2 I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
NEGATIVE:-2 it is made of plastic . 
NEGATIVE:-2 00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. 
NEGATIVE:-3 Still has terrible software.  
NEGATIVE:-2 the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . 
POSITIVE:3 i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
NEGATIVE:-1 size - bigger than the ipod 
POSITIVE:3 No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.
NEGATIVE:-2 I then realized a major design flaw.
POSITIVE:12 Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.
NEGATIVE:-6 this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks . 
POSITIVE:9 pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery 
POSITIVE:2 Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.
POSITIVE:2 first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's . 
POSITIVE:2  Assembly of the stands is very straightforward , and well detailed in the instructions .
POSITIVE:3 I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!! 
NEGATIVE:-4 after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it . 
POSITIVE:3 4. Play N-Gage games on it.
POSITIVE:3 It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.  
NEGATIVE:-1 the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . 
POSITIVE:3 in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range . 
NEGATIVE:-1 p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? 
POSITIVE:2 i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product . 
POSITIVE:6 the reception and sound quality are top-notch . 
POSITIVE:2 the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 
POSITIVE:8 The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
POSITIVE:4 - the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't . 
POSITIVE:1  The sound is clear and clean but if your not on top of it you ca n't hear a thing .
POSITIVE:1 - speakerphone 
POSITIVE:2 the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is . 
POSITIVE:1 The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.  
NEGATIVE:-2 the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well . 
POSITIVE:3 otherwise , this player is awesome ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.  
POSITIVE:2 i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 
NEGATIVE:-2 relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . 
POSITIVE:3 really happy with this little camera . 
POSITIVE:3 It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
POSITIVE:3 i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
NEGATIVE:-1  Display glitches and flashes also occurred .
POSITIVE:3  I especially love the ` remote ' controller stand with it 's big volume knob and simple selector buttons .
NEGATIVE:-1 My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
NEGATIVE:-2 the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do . 
NEGATIVE:-1  It is also a bit bigger than expected but that 's OK because all I need is something to work with my iphone .
NEGATIVE:-1  My overall experience with this monitor was very poor .
POSITIVE:2 when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Avoid this product at all costs.
POSITIVE:3 i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome . 
NEGATIVE:-2  So slow , that it is not useable for files of any size or back-ups .
POSITIVE:7 it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! 
POSITIVE:5 The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. 
POSITIVE:1  The idea of this device is great : it picks up a 5-day weather forecast from AccuWeather and displays the key elements on its screen .
NEGATIVE:-3 The biggest problem is the installation.
POSITIVE:2 The radio and voice recording are nice. 
POSITIVE:2 i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it . 
POSITIVE:2 this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
NEGATIVE:-1 The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
NEGATIVE:-2  However , some of the latest bandwidth hogging software was starting to bog it down , to the point where I was having to reset it and my computer far too often in order to reclaim a dropped Internet connection .
POSITIVE:3 what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
POSITIVE:2 Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
NEGATIVE:-3 the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers . 
NEGATIVE:-1  SLOW GUI - Be prepared to wait approximately 90 seconds every time you change one of the sub menu items and click that dreaded `` apply '' button ... yes , 1ï¿½1\/2 minutes !
NEGATIVE:-1 up , down , left , and right would have given me better control . 
POSITIVE:3 I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot. 
NEGATIVE:-2 The SD500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months, and the LCD has been broken twice. 
NEGATIVE:-2 The Wizard is particularly sinister. 
NEGATIVE:-1  Unfortunately , the installation software crashed several times and I had to reboot my Vista PC at least twice -- not fun .
POSITIVE:2 Camera is a paper weight. 
NEGATIVE:-1  That and for the center speaker , when I mount it on the wall its so top heavy that it falls forward , leaning out about and inch from the wall .
NEGATIVE:-1 only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet . 
POSITIVE:2 The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.  
POSITIVE:1 the camera was a marvel . 
POSITIVE:1  Even works better on G band than the Linksys .
POSITIVE:3 However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.  
POSITIVE:3 It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
NEGATIVE:-1 the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . 
POSITIVE:2 having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . 
NEGATIVE:-1  However , when you unplug the computer it beeps .
NEGATIVE:-2 1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . 
POSITIVE:1 i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine . 
POSITIVE:1  However , once you crank the volume a little to a level a bit too distracting for the work I like to get done with some background music , viola , the audio is great -LRB- well , this is relative - great for a computer speaker -RRB- .
POSITIVE:2 But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.
POSITIVE:2 the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs . 
POSITIVE:2  The display is large enough , and the text rendering is sharp enough , that you 'll forget entirely about workspace issues .
POSITIVE:2 In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
NEGATIVE:-2  Anyways , back to the point : I 've tried to be so calm over the past month of dealing with Acer and their terrible service and support .
NEGATIVE:-3 T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
NEGATIVE:-3 one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu . 
POSITIVE:2 battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have . 
NEGATIVE:-2 But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
NEGATIVE:-3 From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
NEGATIVE:-2 Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.     
POSITIVE:1  Fits perfectly in the corner of my small desk !!
NEGATIVE:-3 this dvd play is basicly junk . 
NEGATIVE:-1 however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off . 
POSITIVE:4 I have only used it with the 1/4" collet and a 1/2" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.
POSITIVE:2 + screen was good , easy to read 
NEGATIVE:-1  This router started out looking good but then gradually slowed down to the point that even standard def youtube videos and highly compressed IPTV from Hulu Plus would slow down and freeze or stutter .
POSITIVE:3 a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always . 
NEGATIVE:-2 first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed . 
POSITIVE:2 i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take. 
POSITIVE:1  Relatively small desktop footprint too .
POSITIVE:3 I love the camera.
POSITIVE:2 with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
NEGATIVE:-1 The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
NEGATIVE:-2 DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
POSITIVE:3 It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
POSITIVE:3  Bright , vivid , clean lines , wide viewing angle , and best of all - great price !
POSITIVE:1  Wow , this speaker really rocks .
NEGATIVE:-2 This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.    
NEGATIVE:-3 Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
POSITIVE:3 the phones are awesome . 
POSITIVE:3 It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is. 
POSITIVE:1 - Replaceable battery. 
NEGATIVE:-3 getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Hooked up to the D-Link extreme N , connected speed dropped to 18mbps and wireless down to 8mbps .
POSITIVE:1  Excellent monitor .
POSITIVE:2 Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
POSITIVE:3 its really cool . 
NEGATIVE:-3 My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
POSITIVE:1 I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  
POSITIVE:2 As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market. 
POSITIVE:2 but , i would definately recommend this phone . 
NEGATIVE:-1 You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
NEGATIVE:-3 it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it . 
NEGATIVE:-2  The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so. 
NEGATIVE:-5 short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel . 
POSITIVE:4 Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use. 
POSITIVE:6 I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
POSITIVE:4 Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
POSITIVE:4 the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size . 
NEGATIVE:-3 unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed . 
NEGATIVE:-3 so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly . 
POSITIVE:1  The sound quality is very exceptable .
NEGATIVE:-2 Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
POSITIVE:3 the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable . 
POSITIVE:2 I would however highly recommend the m12v router !
NEGATIVE:-1  Last night I needed to reset the router .
POSITIVE:3 Setup in XP was instant and intuitive. 
POSITIVE:3 The phone itself is pretty nice.
POSITIVE:1  The Audio Cube is great .
POSITIVE:2 it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device . 
POSITIVE:5 the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium . 
POSITIVE:3 A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years. 
POSITIVE:1  It also has a 10 year warranty , which is just icing on the cake .
POSITIVE:2  That is surface stuff , but the speed and memory is very good .
POSITIVE:2  The speaker arived in excellent condition .
POSITIVE:2 The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use. 
NEGATIVE:-2 they are not wowable good . 
POSITIVE:3 I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
POSITIVE:1 but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing . 
POSITIVE:3 After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
POSITIVE:2 i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . 
NEGATIVE:-1  - Ported sub woofer not appropriate for this set up .
POSITIVE:3  Very tight joints , excellent black finish , and precise speaker wire hook-ups .
NEGATIVE:-1  <p> It 's not lite on weight ... so sad ... I definately recommend it to anyone out there .
POSITIVE:1  Vocals have greater clarity with the iHome as well .
POSITIVE:1 the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing . 
POSITIVE:2 transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad . 
POSITIVE:9 For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
POSITIVE:2 the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . 
NEGATIVE:-3 it has never worked . 
POSITIVE:1  The D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router works fine as a 802.11 n wireless router .
NEGATIVE:-1 no line out jack - as i said , there is none . 
POSITIVE:1 the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click . 
POSITIVE:2 I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
NEGATIVE:-1  Conclusion : I was ready to pay the shipping to return the speakers the day I got them .
POSITIVE:2 I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself. 
POSITIVE:2 I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
POSITIVE:18 I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
NEGATIVE:-1 the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile . 
POSITIVE:1  They deliver great 5.1 sound when hooked up and ACTUALLY RECEIVING A 5.1 SIGNAL .
POSITIVE:4 but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! 
NEGATIVE:-1  There are limitations to what you can do with frequency adjustments because of the built-in speaker crossovers .
POSITIVE:2 the phone is very light weight . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. 
NEGATIVE:-1 Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
POSITIVE:1  Made call which was immediately answered by very helpful , competent tech .
POSITIVE:4 It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.  
NEGATIVE:-2 There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
POSITIVE:2 Mine installed no problem (but I DID uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus 2002 & Personal Firewall 2002 first).
POSITIVE:3 nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com 
NEGATIVE:-3 the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . 
NEGATIVE:-3 My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
NEGATIVE:-3 apex sucks ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad . 
POSITIVE:2  Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
NEGATIVE:-4 it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . 
POSITIVE:3 The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
POSITIVE:3 I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
NEGATIVE:-3 I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
POSITIVE:1  Image clarity is great -LRB- I do a lot of work in PhotoShop with 18MB RAW image files and noticed the difference immediately -RRB- .
NEGATIVE:-3 in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control . 
POSITIVE:1  This is an excellent value .
POSITIVE:2 contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . 
POSITIVE:1  This product is hard to beat at any price .
POSITIVE:6 Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.     
POSITIVE:2 very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . 
POSITIVE:1  No dead pixels on mine .
POSITIVE:9 Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
POSITIVE:2 the software comes with plenty of defaults genres . 
POSITIVE:1 Its well made and user friendly.
NEGATIVE:-2 i can only hear the sound but no picture ! 
POSITIVE:2 Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
POSITIVE:3 huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing . 
POSITIVE:2 it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket . 
NEGATIVE:-3 This router was a huge disapointment.
POSITIVE:2 Love the speaker phone.
POSITIVE:2 And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.  
POSITIVE:2 Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
POSITIVE:3  For the price , the sound is great and their portability -LRB- pack down to a large egg-shape -RRB- is quite good .
POSITIVE:2 The inital setup of the router was simple. 
POSITIVE:4 and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! 
POSITIVE:3 Another 5 star performance. 
NEGATIVE:-5 this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues . 
POSITIVE:1  I ordered it on a Monday afternoon -LRB- around 2 PM -RRB- and with no extra shipping costs , the monitor was at my door in Chicago by the time I got home from work Tuesday .
NEGATIVE:-3 it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . ) 
POSITIVE:2 you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  
POSITIVE:2 The sound is very nice.  
NEGATIVE:-3 This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
POSITIVE:2 it has all the features one would need in a cellphone . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . 
POSITIVE:2  The Satellites are good but the corsair is more responsive and clean .
POSITIVE:1 well , it was nice while it lasted . 
NEGATIVE:-2 CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
NEGATIVE:-2 * I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable. 
POSITIVE:2 b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive . 
POSITIVE:6 the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual . 
POSITIVE:4 I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
POSITIVE:3 5 stars all the way!
POSITIVE:2 at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! 
POSITIVE:3 i just bought this player today and i already love it . 
POSITIVE:3 All the good reviews for the SD500 are true. 
POSITIVE:2 whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
POSITIVE:2  I mainly use it with my Apple IPad and it really sounds quite good for it diminutive size .
POSITIVE:2 feels solid in hand . 
POSITIVE:2 also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . 
POSITIVE:1 The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.  
NEGATIVE:-2 the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now . 
POSITIVE:1  It is slightly slower than the dell , but it is hard to notice with the very nice screen quality and larger hard drive .
POSITIVE:4 the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! 
POSITIVE:3 it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping . 
POSITIVE:2 Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. 
NEGATIVE:-3 If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while. 
NEGATIVE:-2 Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
NEGATIVE:-3 Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
POSITIVE:2 I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out 
POSITIVE:1  As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough. 
POSITIVE:1 however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take . 
POSITIVE:1 Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
POSITIVE:1 I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
NEGATIVE:-1  -LRB- lost internet connection with the router , internet service was restored when the computer was connected directly to the modem -RRB- .
NEGATIVE:-2 The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case. 
POSITIVE:2 it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice . 
POSITIVE:2 in general it is easy to use and well laid out . 
POSITIVE:2 At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
POSITIVE:3 but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers . 
POSITIVE:1 All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
POSITIVE:3 To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins. 
POSITIVE:3 i am very pleased so far . 
NEGATIVE:-3 the software failed repeatedly . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint . 
POSITIVE:3 I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
NEGATIVE:-1  In that regard , I am still having difficulty attempting to get the SharePort Utility to function normally .
POSITIVE:1 It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.
NEGATIVE:-2 The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
POSITIVE:2 But it; you won't regret it.     
POSITIVE:3 I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
POSITIVE:2 it has a classic design yet looks hip . 
POSITIVE:4 I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. 
POSITIVE:1  It also has excellent coverage through our two story house .
NEGATIVE:-3 i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero . 
NEGATIVE:-3 imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Hard drive screws up occasionally
POSITIVE:4 i love the eos based controls and easy menus . 
POSITIVE:3 It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
NEGATIVE:-3 Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
POSITIVE:2 I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
NEGATIVE:-1 the remote is a little hard to understand . 
POSITIVE:3 The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
POSITIVE:3 i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again . 
NEGATIVE:-1  Since it would not work as advertised I called support .
POSITIVE:1 Otherwise, this is a great "alternative" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple. 
POSITIVE:1  its definately an outstanding laptop .
POSITIVE:1  And it works great too !
POSITIVE:2 either way , can 't go wrong with this price . 
POSITIVE:1  If I were to rate these speakers on my listening needs , I would give a 2.5 stars , but I 'm giving 4 because I think they do the job that most people want them for .
NEGATIVE:-2 the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press . 
POSITIVE:3 but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
NEGATIVE:-1  D-Link does not provide Mac support for the adapter , however I was able to find a free third-party driver that is compatible .
POSITIVE:3 Go for the Champ.
NEGATIVE:-1 * main dial is not backlit . 
POSITIVE:1  These were only my first week impressions but , until now , I strongly recommend this product and I 'm very satisfied with it .
POSITIVE:3 Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player. 
POSITIVE:2 technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! ! 
POSITIVE:1 Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
POSITIVE:2 but this camera is great ! 
POSITIVE:2 the moveable lcd screen is great . 
NEGATIVE:-3 the software sucks . 
NEGATIVE:-1  USB Network storage - `` supposedly '' it 's slow .
POSITIVE:4 with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great . 
POSITIVE:3 The interface is simple to use.
POSITIVE:1  You can stop looking : This is the best n-router you will find today -LRB- I am writing this on 03 Nov 2011 -RRB- .
NEGATIVE:-2 in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place . 
POSITIVE:2 I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
NEGATIVE:-4 1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
NEGATIVE:-3 There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens. 
POSITIVE:2 In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.  
NEGATIVE:-1 It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
POSITIVE:2 It has plenty of power.
POSITIVE:4 3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The problems came from my video card .
NEGATIVE:-1  There is no speaker grill to offer any protection to the driver .
POSITIVE:2 I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing. 
POSITIVE:2 The startup time, quality of pictures and videos is outstanding.
NEGATIVE:-1 the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 
NEGATIVE:-2  Also, not liking the gel case. 
POSITIVE:4 Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.  
POSITIVE:1 The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
POSITIVE:2  The clarity and contrast are exactly what I was looking for in a monitor , and spec for spec , it is a bargain compared to other brands .
NEGATIVE:-1  - Fixed speaker cable -- why do this ?
POSITIVE:4 this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . 
POSITIVE:1  For those who want the thump that this is capable of producing -LRB- very good for a computer speaker -RRB- , this is probably necessary .
NEGATIVE:-1 -- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best . 
NEGATIVE:-2 only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . 
POSITIVE:1  Easy to hook up .
POSITIVE:3 great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great. 
POSITIVE:3 I've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views.
NEGATIVE:-2 little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.  
POSITIVE:2 A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
POSITIVE:3  The speakers perform very well , and with the bass boost , the sound fills outs exceedingly well .
NEGATIVE:-1 The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click. 
NEGATIVE:-2 it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working? 
POSITIVE:3 I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.
NEGATIVE:-2 The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
NEGATIVE:-2 the entire unit was poorly crafted . 
POSITIVE:2 when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price . 
POSITIVE:1  Had a JVC system that was 6 years old and I thought it was good , but the Onkyo sound is amazing !
POSITIVE:4 I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed. 
NEGATIVE:-3 i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for . 
POSITIVE:1 FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
POSITIVE:3 i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
NEGATIVE:-2 i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem . 
POSITIVE:1 For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
POSITIVE:3 A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.  
POSITIVE:5 And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
POSITIVE:3 and we definitely prefer our Champ!
NEGATIVE:-2 although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product . 
POSITIVE:2 no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers . 
POSITIVE:3 for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison . 
POSITIVE:1  I 'm not easily impressed by electronics , tending to be a little conservative , but this product really deserves five stars .
NEGATIVE:-2 the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . 
POSITIVE:5 i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate . 
POSITIVE:2 the service from t-mobile is very good too . 
POSITIVE:1 Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
POSITIVE:2 I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
POSITIVE:1 iPod is brilliant, but service was awful
POSITIVE:2 this is a good deal for music and data storage . 
NEGATIVE:-2 but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes . 
POSITIVE:2 You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).   
NEGATIVE:-3 And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
POSITIVE:2 Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.  
POSITIVE:2  My fiance ordered this computer , she 's a teacher so she needed a small computer that would keep her from bringing work home with her .
POSITIVE:2 Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router. 
NEGATIVE:-2 The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
POSITIVE:1   The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel. 
POSITIVE:4 the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent . 
POSITIVE:2 i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy . 
NEGATIVE:-1 whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side. 
POSITIVE:3 The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
NEGATIVE:-2 for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it . 
POSITIVE:1  This LED monitor is fantastic !!!
POSITIVE:3 1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.
NEGATIVE:-2 unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
POSITIVE:3 Seems to work great.
NEGATIVE:-1 Can't get easier than that!
POSITIVE:3 This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
POSITIVE:1 I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
POSITIVE:2 i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???  
NEGATIVE:-2 I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
NEGATIVE:-1 2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured . 
NEGATIVE:-8 battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive 
POSITIVE:3 it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
NEGATIVE:-1 i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver . 
POSITIVE:3 the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices . 
POSITIVE:2 i had no problems following their installation instructions . 
POSITIVE:2 i am very pleased with it so far . 
POSITIVE:1  Great Coverage .
POSITIVE:3 Bottom line great phone for the time being.
POSITIVE:1  I highly recomend theese speakers .
POSITIVE:2 All in all, this is a wonderful device.  
POSITIVE:1  My 2 XBoxs , Ipod , Iphone , Ipad are all catching a nice strong signal .
POSITIVE:2 This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another. 
POSITIVE:3 it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail. 
POSITIVE:2 The battery is removable. 
NEGATIVE:-3 This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
POSITIVE:2 i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer . 
POSITIVE:1 The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).  
POSITIVE:1  Great speakers overall .
POSITIVE:3 this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection. 
POSITIVE:2 i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement . 
POSITIVE:3 A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
NEGATIVE:-1  2 weeks later , The monitor start having other issues , only half screen turns on , or it become a full green screen and doesnt change , you need to turn it off and on again until it works .
POSITIVE:1 We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
NEGATIVE:-3 The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
POSITIVE:1  I did have problem connecting my laptop to the internet but there customer service representative was very helpful and patient in walking me through all the steps .
NEGATIVE:-1 The depth adjustment was sloppy.
POSITIVE:3 When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive. 
NEGATIVE:-2 i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing . 
POSITIVE:4 progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1 depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . 
NEGATIVE:-2 When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
NEGATIVE:-2 The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
POSITIVE:3 it plays everything , even vcd 's . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The tech support is worthless too.     
POSITIVE:2 the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them . 
POSITIVE:2 The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it. 
NEGATIVE:-1  Meanwhile , the instructions for Apple users indicated I should load the CD-ROM , but it turns out it only contained a PDF of instructions and offered nothing by way of explanation on installing for Apple computers .
NEGATIVE:-2 i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet . 
NEGATIVE:-3 You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
NEGATIVE:-3 One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.  
POSITIVE:2 It definitely keeps the smell out.
POSITIVE:2  All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.  
POSITIVE:2  It 's just such a nice , light-weight , non-intrusive device which you can take anywhere .
NEGATIVE:-2 . even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image 
NEGATIVE:-2 Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
NEGATIVE:-1  The interface was atrocious ; several elements simply did n't work at all .
POSITIVE:1 I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
POSITIVE:3 The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
POSITIVE:2  - Input and headphone on right jack is super handy .
POSITIVE:5  Beautiful home theater and music speaker ... crisp highs , defined mids , and respectable bass .
POSITIVE:2 another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . 
NEGATIVE:-1  The only drawback is the speaker wire is very thin .
POSITIVE:2 yes , i recommend it over the competition . 
POSITIVE:3 i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The buttons are rather stiff. 
NEGATIVE:-1  For my work this panel is unusable .
POSITIVE:1 battery life is ok . 
POSITIVE:2 The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
POSITIVE:2 battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours . 
POSITIVE:3 They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact. 
POSITIVE:3 I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.     
POSITIVE:1  We like Acer products and this one does n't disappoint .
NEGATIVE:-2 the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best . 
POSITIVE:1 While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.  
NEGATIVE:-2  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
POSITIVE:2 I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
POSITIVE:2 but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. 
POSITIVE:2 The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
NEGATIVE:-2 this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas . 
POSITIVE:8 sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!  
NEGATIVE:-1  Have the latest firmware but as many others have described , the router will randomly stop working for 5 minutes then work again .
NEGATIVE:-2 i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked . 
POSITIVE:3 Creative did an awesome job with the design. 
NEGATIVE:-1 some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I have been disappointed to find that there is no printed instructions with it , just a crude pictorial instruction of installation , which leaves a great deal of information missing .
POSITIVE:1 the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on . 
POSITIVE:2 i love this camera . 
POSITIVE:3 I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice. 
POSITIVE:8 it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . 
NEGATIVE:-6 then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . 
NEGATIVE:-2  Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
NEGATIVE:-2 I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
POSITIVE:5 Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.
POSITIVE:3 what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . 
NEGATIVE:-5 well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . 
POSITIVE:2 Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2" 
POSITIVE:1 it also lets you remove songs from the play order . 
POSITIVE:1  There are no incompatibility problems and they work fine .
POSITIVE:1  After seeing and hearing the sound of the I-Tour Pop speaker , I was sold .
NEGATIVE:-1 it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack . 
NEGATIVE:-2 this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . 
POSITIVE:3 i highly recommend a nokia 6610 . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
NEGATIVE:-1  WITHOUT having to go through the netgear genie tool through the ISP and taking all the extra steps would be far better .
POSITIVE:1 One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
NEGATIVE:-3 i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 Recenly the variable speed control went out.
POSITIVE:2 have used it frequently and have had no problems . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.
POSITIVE:13 great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price . 
POSITIVE:2  I went out and got the Canon today. 
POSITIVE:2 Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery. 
POSITIVE:2 the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . 
POSITIVE:2 - uploading music is quick and easy . 
POSITIVE:3 The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!
POSITIVE:2 We've never experienced odor from the pail.
POSITIVE:2 the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool . 
NEGATIVE:-2 about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . 
POSITIVE:1 There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock. 
POSITIVE:3 I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
POSITIVE:8 I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
POSITIVE:1  I 'm sure it would and can be useful in a different setting ; one where you would only need your volume to be at a whisper .
POSITIVE:1 Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.   
POSITIVE:1  I seem to be getting 5 to 6 hours on the battery which is sufficient for my needs .
NEGATIVE:-2 First off, the battery.
NEGATIVE:-3 have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid . 
NEGATIVE:-1  First thing I tested was the speed , and I have to say it was abysmal .
POSITIVE:4 Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.  
POSITIVE:3 because this camera is beautiful . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
POSITIVE:3 Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.  
NEGATIVE:-2 But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
POSITIVE:3 Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
NEGATIVE:-1  The incoming call volume is incredibly low and it is often difficult to hear my customers -LRB- it was so bad I had my hearing tested because I thought something was wrong with me .
POSITIVE:1   Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.
POSITIVE:3 service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great . 
POSITIVE:2 Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on. 
NEGATIVE:-1 The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
POSITIVE:6 It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
POSITIVE:2 Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc. 
POSITIVE:3 huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you . 
POSITIVE:2 I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.     
POSITIVE:2 It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. 
POSITIVE:1  they were easy to install and ended up using 300 feet of cable .
POSITIVE:3 another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! 
POSITIVE:3 The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player. 
POSITIVE:1 The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
POSITIVE:3 A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
POSITIVE:3  Well , I can not complain about the volume , bass or mounting abilities of the system .
NEGATIVE:-1 It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
POSITIVE:2 besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! 
POSITIVE:2 the powershot g3 is a great camera . 
POSITIVE:4 The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
POSITIVE:3 ) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. 
NEGATIVE:-3 I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
POSITIVE:1 UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
POSITIVE:1 I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results. 
POSITIVE:2 Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
POSITIVE:2 i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . 
POSITIVE:3 No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.
POSITIVE:2 this phone is a winner ... 
POSITIVE:3 This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. 
POSITIVE:1  Sharp , crisp images .
POSITIVE:1 All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one. 
POSITIVE:3 i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly . 
NEGATIVE:-3 difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate . 
POSITIVE:4 3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.
POSITIVE:5 the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ... 
NEGATIVE:-2 - this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last . 
POSITIVE:4 First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
POSITIVE:2 once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
POSITIVE:4 But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.
POSITIVE:3 usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast . 
POSITIVE:2 i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well . 
NEGATIVE:-2 what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.
NEGATIVE:-2 4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
NEGATIVE:-3 You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. 
NEGATIVE:-1 The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
NEGATIVE:-2 It is hot enough to be annoying.
POSITIVE:3 Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).
POSITIVE:3 This is a GREAT product!
NEGATIVE:-3 my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units . 
NEGATIVE:-1 This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files. 
POSITIVE:1  Fantastic display ... do n't understand why this model is n't available anymore .
POSITIVE:3 The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  
NEGATIVE:-6 Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
NEGATIVE:-1  Acer has been awful to deal with , they treat their customers like rubbish , and have a miserable repair facility to match their products .
POSITIVE:3 It has it all.
POSITIVE:2 i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly . 
POSITIVE:6 awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package . 
POSITIVE:2  I have seen no dead pixels or color bleeding that I 've heard about with other ACER models
NEGATIVE:-2 The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive. 
NEGATIVE:-2 the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I took it out one day and the LCD was not working. 
NEGATIVE:-3 In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
POSITIVE:2 you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . 
POSITIVE:3 the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry . 
POSITIVE:3 It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
POSITIVE:4 the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling . 
POSITIVE:3 I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  
POSITIVE:3 It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
NEGATIVE:-1  I could tell this was a `` cheap '' monitor as soon as I set it up .
POSITIVE:3 i highly recommend this phone to anyone . 
POSITIVE:1  The sound is so good that my boyfriend wants one now !
POSITIVE:2 with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . 
POSITIVE:1 It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
POSITIVE:2 It works with a minimum of fuss.
POSITIVE:6 It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.      
POSITIVE:6 It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
POSITIVE:3 Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room. 
POSITIVE:2 i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful . 
POSITIVE:1  I have no problem at all recommending these stands .
POSITIVE:2 i am quite happy with the camera . 
NEGATIVE:-2 the vibrate setting is loud ! 
NEGATIVE:-1 I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software. 
POSITIVE:3 There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.  
NEGATIVE:-3 I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
NEGATIVE:-2 what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds . 
POSITIVE:1 i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . 
NEGATIVE:-3 what the hell is wrong with this thing . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine . 
POSITIVE:2 the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily . 
POSITIVE:1  This setup worked perfectly the first shot at it .
POSITIVE:3 I absolutely love it. 
POSITIVE:3  I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
POSITIVE:10 The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.  
POSITIVE:2 the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter . 
POSITIVE:2 The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.  
POSITIVE:6 longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
NEGATIVE:-2 you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . 
NEGATIVE:-3 HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
NEGATIVE:-2 also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order . 
POSITIVE:3 Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable. 
POSITIVE:1  The first 2 routers worked good for years .
POSITIVE:3 This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year. 
POSITIVE:3 I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.
POSITIVE:3 It is quiet and has plenty of power.
NEGATIVE:-1 These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
NEGATIVE:-1 I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey. 
POSITIVE:3 The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
POSITIVE:2  The rechargeable battery is a great feature .
POSITIVE:3   EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
NEGATIVE:-2 Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.
NEGATIVE:-1 where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  
NEGATIVE:-2 the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
NEGATIVE:-3 Stay away from this product!
POSITIVE:5 it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . 
POSITIVE:1  Also , it was very easy to set up a route to my WAMP server as the process was exactly the same as my old NetGear .
POSITIVE:2 Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
NEGATIVE:-2 It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  
POSITIVE:1  They sound really good just as the reviews say .
NEGATIVE:-1 the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine ! 
POSITIVE:6 our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price . 
POSITIVE:3 Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
POSITIVE:3  We own two sets of these -LRB- black -RRB- and I am very pleased with the performance of the these compact speakers , especially at the low price these sell for here on Amazon .
POSITIVE:3 Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
POSITIVE:2 just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it. 
NEGATIVE:-2 5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control . 
POSITIVE:1  Great replacement at great price for an older bulky and heavy monitor .
NEGATIVE:-1 The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.
POSITIVE:3 i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . 
POSITIVE:6 i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! 
NEGATIVE:-3 To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
POSITIVE:1 i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there . 
POSITIVE:3 it is a very amazing product . 
NEGATIVE:-6 however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips . 
NEGATIVE:-2 finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . 
POSITIVE:2 6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
POSITIVE:3 The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.  
NEGATIVE:-1  And finally , in early June , this router stopped broadcasting an internet signal .
NEGATIVE:-1 Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
NEGATIVE:-2 ) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. 
POSITIVE:3 I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
POSITIVE:2 in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
NEGATIVE:-3  Very cheap quality item and beside that one of the speaker was bad and the sound out of it was like you are whisling .
POSITIVE:3 I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
NEGATIVE:-1 It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music. 
NEGATIVE:-4 the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . 
POSITIVE:3 I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
NEGATIVE:-1 I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now. 
POSITIVE:3 I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. 
POSITIVE:2  Compared to the 19 '' Dell Monitor this replaced it is far brighter and weighs much less .
POSITIVE:2 my first impression was positive . 
POSITIVE:2 the sound quality is very good . 
POSITIVE:1  It 's very light-weight , which is why I use this more than my Alienware .
POSITIVE:2 the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise . 
POSITIVE:1  Awesome sound system .
NEGATIVE:-2  I felt the system was slow so I purchased a 4gb ram from crucell and replaced the standard 2gb that came with the system .
NEGATIVE:-4 The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.  
POSITIVE:3 i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers . 
NEGATIVE:-1 This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
NEGATIVE:-6 (It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked. 
POSITIVE:3 These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
NEGATIVE:-2 its quiet . 
POSITIVE:1 digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
NEGATIVE:-1 one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like . 
POSITIVE:1 1- Small.
POSITIVE:1  Set up WPA with no problems .
POSITIVE:2  You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
POSITIVE:1  After much frustration , I finally upgraded the firmware to the latest DD-WRT firmware at DD-WRT 's website and it resolved all my problems .
POSITIVE:2 the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting . 
POSITIVE:2  It 's so small , but big value Mac .
NEGATIVE:-2 in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . 
POSITIVE:3 I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
POSITIVE:1  My brother and I were equally shocked at how loud this thing really is .
NEGATIVE:-3 Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.  
POSITIVE:3 unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.  
POSITIVE:2 you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games . 
POSITIVE:1  The second set is working just fine .
POSITIVE:4 Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore. 
POSITIVE:2 this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out . 
POSITIVE:2 it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market . 
POSITIVE:1 I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera. 
NEGATIVE:-1  Well the theory was great , but upon enabling the guest network , things stopped working .
NEGATIVE:-5 Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
POSITIVE:6 i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . 
POSITIVE:2 from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone . 
POSITIVE:3 * slick-looking design and improved interface 
POSITIVE:3 i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route . 
NEGATIVE:-2 Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
POSITIVE:3 I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
POSITIVE:3 But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.
NEGATIVE:-3 i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response . 
POSITIVE:1 I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
POSITIVE:2 value : comparing data storage with price . 
NEGATIVE:-1 i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size . 
POSITIVE:1  The size is small .
NEGATIVE:-1 But not good enough for me.
POSITIVE:2 as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better . 
POSITIVE:4 I like the size and shape.
POSITIVE:3 a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) 
POSITIVE:2 color screen is good . 
NEGATIVE:-1  I would not recommend this or any Acer product to anyone except perhaps my ex .
POSITIVE:2 not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless . 
POSITIVE:3 the other controls are all very easy to use . 
NEGATIVE:-6 can 't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me . 
POSITIVE:1 The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
POSITIVE:3 3. Play Java games on it.
NEGATIVE:-1  The only downside is the remote which requires a line of sight .
POSITIVE:2 it takes great pictures . 
POSITIVE:4  I got it today , it works great , great sound for its size and price , I understand that the volume for iPhone and the towers own volume are two different things that should be placed at the right measures to get the better sound quality so I do n't complain for the fact of the remote not being able to control my iPhone , I highly recommend this tower .
NEGATIVE:-2 on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm . 
NEGATIVE:-1 in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . 
POSITIVE:5 I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  
POSITIVE:5 The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
POSITIVE:1  I personally would recommend this router in every house hold or small buisiness environmnets .
NEGATIVE:-3 maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . 
NEGATIVE:-1 in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it . 
POSITIVE:2 - large easy readable screen 
POSITIVE:2 we tried it out christmas night and it worked great . 
POSITIVE:2 - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily . 
POSITIVE:2 overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most. 
NEGATIVE:-1 1 no direct firewire to the camera . 
POSITIVE:4 the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive . 
POSITIVE:1 The included earphones are pretty good - my advice? 
NEGATIVE:-2 If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
NEGATIVE:-1 there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient . 
POSITIVE:2 This is really a nice diaper pail.
POSITIVE:2 the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood . 
POSITIVE:2 The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.      
POSITIVE:1  It costs me about 640 $ so you should be gratefull that the pricess in the states much lower .
POSITIVE:3 definetely a great camera . 
POSITIVE:2 the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god . 
POSITIVE:1  My DWL-2100AP does not work as a repeater for DI-624S and there is no firmware update to support this product .
NEGATIVE:-2 It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.  
POSITIVE:3 There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
POSITIVE:2 i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me . 
NEGATIVE:-1 This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
POSITIVE:1 I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
POSITIVE:2 I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).  
POSITIVE:1 I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
NEGATIVE:-1 2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information . 
POSITIVE:2 the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate . 
POSITIVE:2 am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
POSITIVE:2 10 great price for all the features . 
POSITIVE:2 For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod. 
NEGATIVE:-3 i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds . 
POSITIVE:1 I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.  
POSITIVE:3 the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . 
NEGATIVE:-3 Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY. 
POSITIVE:1  It has a USB port -- so you can plug in a USB-powered drive and have network-accessible storage .
POSITIVE:2 this is a great camera for you ! 
POSITIVE:3 the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
POSITIVE:3 Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. 
POSITIVE:2  Pros : - Great Sound - Sleek cool look - Compact - Comes with RCA adapter - Speakers all swivel so they can be wall mounted Cons : - Mainly for PC only -LRB- but works fairly well with TV 's -RRB- - Wattage is n't all that high - No immediate line in -LRB- so you ca n't hook your MP3 player up and get SRS right out of the box -RRB- I 've heard a bunch of people say that the cord 's for the rear speakers are n't long enough .
NEGATIVE:-1 Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  
POSITIVE:2 nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . 
POSITIVE:3 I love this pail!
POSITIVE:2 I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
POSITIVE:1 Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
POSITIVE:2 the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing . 
POSITIVE:3  Affordable price , reliable item and excellent customer service .
POSITIVE:2 comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small . 
POSITIVE:2 + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great . 
POSITIVE:3 sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products . 
POSITIVE:2 i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel. 
POSITIVE:2 With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
POSITIVE:4 If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.             
POSITIVE:3 before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there . 
POSITIVE:3 usb 2.0 - very fast 
NEGATIVE:-2 about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc . 
POSITIVE:1 you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance . 
POSITIVE:1  This machine will change your whole idea of what a laptop should be .
NEGATIVE:-1  The next day , I turned on my laptop and it connected to the network , but no internet connection .
POSITIVE:1 but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything . 
POSITIVE:2  Amazing speed and easy to set up .
POSITIVE:1  Works super easy .
POSITIVE:5 the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner . 
NEGATIVE:-1 No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
POSITIVE:1 i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . 
POSITIVE:1 The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  
POSITIVE:12 very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
NEGATIVE:-1 ) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long. 
POSITIVE:1  I was pleasantly surprised that customer service was able to step me thru manual setup .
POSITIVE:1  When I saw a lot of plastic where there was metal I was concerned that the sound would not be as good .
POSITIVE:2 after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket . 
POSITIVE:3 when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! 
POSITIVE:1 The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.  
NEGATIVE:-1  The interface took a little getting used to.
NEGATIVE:-2 Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible.
POSITIVE:1   With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster. 
NEGATIVE:-2 My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
POSITIVE:2 working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! ! 
POSITIVE:3 to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player . 
POSITIVE:5 i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures. 
POSITIVE:3 its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus. 
POSITIVE:1 I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.   
POSITIVE:1 easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
POSITIVE:3 i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
POSITIVE:2 It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
NEGATIVE:-1   And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.  
POSITIVE:2 although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent . 
POSITIVE:2 for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player . 
NEGATIVE:-1  This product did not work at all .
POSITIVE:2  Easy set up and the picture was crystal clear .
POSITIVE:5 the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing . 
POSITIVE:4 I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
POSITIVE:3 The sound is amazing. 
POSITIVE:1  I have this connected to my late 2008 MacBook Pro , and it works flawlessly .
POSITIVE:1 Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
NEGATIVE:-1  Besides , I hate widescreen monitors !!!!
NEGATIVE:-3 DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
POSITIVE:2  This is a great portable speaker system , but wanted to let people know that if your ipod is in an iSkin case you can not dock the ipod without first removing the skin .
POSITIVE:2  Both units are small , with similarly small speakers .
POSITIVE:3 i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
POSITIVE:3 get it , it 's woth every penny ! ! 
NEGATIVE:-2  The stand is by far the most inferior aspect of this monitor .
NEGATIVE:-2 the general button placement is not very user friendly . 
POSITIVE:3 however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice . 
NEGATIVE:-4 The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.   
NEGATIVE:-2 if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . 
NEGATIVE:-2 f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course 
POSITIVE:3 The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
POSITIVE:3 This camera is so easy to use!
POSITIVE:6 This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
POSITIVE:5 2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
NEGATIVE:-2 Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
POSITIVE:2   Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.  
POSITIVE:2 for the money apex machines have good features . 
POSITIVE:1  Well , this speaker does the same wonders for my low-end HT setup .
POSITIVE:2 it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . 
POSITIVE:3 and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy . 
POSITIVE:1  These speakers are great .
NEGATIVE:-1 You must keep double checking depths.
POSITIVE:3 If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.     
POSITIVE:2 VERY smal.
NEGATIVE:-1  However , SharePort on this new router worked 0 % of the time .
POSITIVE:2 oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy . 
POSITIVE:3  This small size speaker system pumps out great sounds with most MP3 players , including Sansas and Ipods .
NEGATIVE:-1  It is tall , so I ended up laying it on its side .
POSITIVE:8 it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  
POSITIVE:2  A great system at an incredible price .
NEGATIVE:-1 It DOES take some getting used to. 
NEGATIVE:-3 Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
POSITIVE:2 The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent. 
NEGATIVE:-2 deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). 
NEGATIVE:-2 the interface used could be better designed . 
NEGATIVE:-3 only used for 3 month before it 's down ! 
POSITIVE:2 the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . 
POSITIVE:2 Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool. 
POSITIVE:4 The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
POSITIVE:1  Reliable , Highly available and ease of administration and forget about me -LRB- Do n't bother anymore -RRB- equipment !
POSITIVE:1 The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
POSITIVE:3  The sound is surprising full , with a fair amount of bass , even for such a small unit .
POSITIVE:4 1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers . 
NEGATIVE:-1 I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen. 
POSITIVE:2 The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
POSITIVE:1  I spent 1.5 hours on the phone with their Tech Support -LRB- you get connected right away and do n't have to wait -RRB- and got at least my iMac and MacBook back online .
POSITIVE:3 the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use . 
POSITIVE:2 Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
NEGATIVE:-4 I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
POSITIVE:2 the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them . 
POSITIVE:1  I love this monitor .
POSITIVE:2 the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) . 
NEGATIVE:-1  No one sells a 1.2 mm x 2.2 mm sized -LRB- or what ever stupid size it is -RRB- power adapter .
NEGATIVE:-3 neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . ) 
POSITIVE:3 overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it . 
NEGATIVE:-2 it also has unproven battery life . 
POSITIVE:2 It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
NEGATIVE:-1  They are a bit top heavy , as any tower will be .
POSITIVE:1  Ca n't beat it for the price .
POSITIVE:2 the more i work with it , the more i love it ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing . 
POSITIVE:2 one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) . 
NEGATIVE:-2 but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
POSITIVE:2 I am very pleased with my purchase.
POSITIVE:5 overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! 
NEGATIVE:-4 There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.  
POSITIVE:2 It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.  
NEGATIVE:-1 8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
POSITIVE:4 anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.  
POSITIVE:2 the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had . 
POSITIVE:6 However, this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes. 
NEGATIVE:-2 it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad . 
NEGATIVE:-4 but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture . 
NEGATIVE:-1 the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well . 
POSITIVE:2 i liked this one enough to buy another . 
POSITIVE:1  All in all , this is a very good option for anyone who has a small portable computer and wants a lapdesk and external speakers .
POSITIVE:1  These a great speakers - full of sound .
POSITIVE:2 Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
NEGATIVE:-1 Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. 
POSITIVE:3 drops and strong signals even from the backyard. 
POSITIVE:3 c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer . 
NEGATIVE:-1 Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
NEGATIVE:-3 a bit dissapoitnd on that!
POSITIVE:2 overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
POSITIVE:3  The!  sound quality is great. 
POSITIVE:2 all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product . 
NEGATIVE:-2 To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC. 
POSITIVE:1  They are clears and perfect to be used along with a sub .
POSITIVE:1 2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
POSITIVE:3 In conclusion, this player is beautiful. 
POSITIVE:3 Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
POSITIVE:3 you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too . 
POSITIVE:2   Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.
POSITIVE:2 No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
NEGATIVE:-2 * does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ). 
POSITIVE:6 great colors , pictures and white balance . 
NEGATIVE:-2 I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.
POSITIVE:2 the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
POSITIVE:3 The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
POSITIVE:1 That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!      
POSITIVE:1 Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
NEGATIVE:-2 the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on . 
POSITIVE:3 i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer . 
NEGATIVE:-1  My only complaint , is that the cord is not long enough .
NEGATIVE:-2 enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . 
NEGATIVE:-3 i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept . 
NEGATIVE:-2 - no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones . 
POSITIVE:2 All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network. 
POSITIVE:2 great price . 
POSITIVE:2 It's faster than WMP. 
POSITIVE:2 the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product . 
POSITIVE:3 Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
POSITIVE:2 despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. . 
POSITIVE:2  it is lighter to carry around and it has enough functionality to use .
POSITIVE:3 this is the best dvd player i 've purchased . 
NEGATIVE:-3 I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked. 
NEGATIVE:-1  Bottom Line - Do n't buy this for the USB function .
POSITIVE:2 The panorama modes are wonderful.
NEGATIVE:-2 it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman . 
NEGATIVE:-4 Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
POSITIVE:2 well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) . 
POSITIVE:1 I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.  
POSITIVE:2 Sharper pictures. 
POSITIVE:2 the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) . 
POSITIVE:1  Delivery was prompt .
POSITIVE:1  Volume level is OK .
POSITIVE:1 The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".
POSITIVE:1 look at the size of it!
POSITIVE:2 you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
POSITIVE:2  The player is great. 
POSITIVE:2 Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
POSITIVE:2 i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs . 
POSITIVE:1  This machine is a replacement for your desktop .
POSITIVE:1 Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
POSITIVE:3 i love it ! ! 
POSITIVE:2 the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it . 
POSITIVE:1  Build quality is great .
POSITIVE:3 It looks sleek and modern. 
NEGATIVE:-2 4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) . 
POSITIVE:2 replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 . 
POSITIVE:2 that 's a rare and valuable feature . 
NEGATIVE:-3 the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap . 
NEGATIVE:-1  It worked reasonably well for a while , although it frequently was barely able to keep up when I tried to stream movies , which was a big part of the reason I went to a faster router in the first place .
POSITIVE:2 This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  
NEGATIVE:-2 also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate . 
POSITIVE:6 4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
POSITIVE:1  However , when I plugged it into my Mac Mini , the screen looked wonderful .
NEGATIVE:-3 third , the poor design continues with the case . 
NEGATIVE:-2 i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . 
POSITIVE:2 Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer. 
NEGATIVE:-2 I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.
POSITIVE:4 The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. 
POSITIVE:1 I purchased two of these beauties.
NEGATIVE:-1  Addition on 4\/14\/2011 \*\*\* I 've just had the 2nd router of this model go bad inside of 5 months .
POSITIVE:1 I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
POSITIVE:2 i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) . 
NEGATIVE:-6 second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed . 
POSITIVE:2 easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton . 
POSITIVE:12 The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.
POSITIVE:3 You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.  
NEGATIVE:-3 i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive . 
POSITIVE:2 The menu is easy to use and understand. 
POSITIVE:2 APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
POSITIVE:3 I love this camera!
POSITIVE:2 this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera . 
POSITIVE:3 and it holds sooooo much music and audio files . 
POSITIVE:1 The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    
NEGATIVE:-2 i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all . 
NEGATIVE:-3 the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel 
POSITIVE:2 i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money . 
POSITIVE:3 The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
NEGATIVE:-1 Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.  
NEGATIVE:-2 my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great . 
NEGATIVE:-3 3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze . 
NEGATIVE:-3 What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
POSITIVE:3 The included software removes any red eye easily. 
POSITIVE:1 it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
POSITIVE:2 the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . 
POSITIVE:2 ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! 
POSITIVE:1  Still for the price you ca n't find better for the cost .
POSITIVE:2 the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. . 
POSITIVE:3 The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
POSITIVE:2 There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router. 
NEGATIVE:-1  The data rate over the network storage is rather slow , but I only use it for occasional backups so it does n't bother me too much .
NEGATIVE:-2 i forgot , the case does n't fit . 
POSITIVE:2 i love the quality of the pictures . 
NEGATIVE:-1 If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
POSITIVE:6 the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless . 
POSITIVE:6 it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too. 
POSITIVE:2 seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . 
POSITIVE:2 one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software . 
POSITIVE:3 this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . 
POSITIVE:4  Easy to set up , no bad pixels , great price for 19 LCD monitor !
POSITIVE:2 After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.  
NEGATIVE:-3 do n't buy this player . 
POSITIVE:3 By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.     
POSITIVE:1 The metal housing seems very rugged.
NEGATIVE:-2 The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
POSITIVE:2  The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days). 
NEGATIVE:-2 Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best. 
POSITIVE:3 this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone . 
POSITIVE:6 - Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.  
NEGATIVE:-1 If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
NEGATIVE:-1 i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem . 
POSITIVE:2  With the small cost it packs a powerful wireless punch
POSITIVE:1  Also has a nice guest feature so your visitors can connect separate of your primary link .
POSITIVE:2 The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process. 
POSITIVE:1 the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit : 
POSITIVE:6 It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.
POSITIVE:2 the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging . 
POSITIVE:1  Sounds awesome .
NEGATIVE:-3 always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped . 
POSITIVE:1  It works great for this purpose .
POSITIVE:4 so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 the dvd player does not work properly . 
POSITIVE:1 now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems . 
POSITIVE:1  The memory is not really hard to upgrade .
POSITIVE:1  Speed tests showed that the wireless speeds were comparable to those of my home wireless router when using my home broadband cable modem as input .
NEGATIVE:-2 Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works. 
POSITIVE:3  The colors and viewing angle are about average , but a huge upgrade from the truly terrible quality of the other monitor .
POSITIVE:1  Sharp image .
POSITIVE:2 ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier . 
POSITIVE:2 i have not been disappointed with my purchase . 
POSITIVE:2  The sound this slim design puts out !!
POSITIVE:2  This really is a laptop in a small form .
POSITIVE:6  Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market. 
NEGATIVE:-2 While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.
NEGATIVE:-3 you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll . 
POSITIVE:2 This is also the case with NIS 2004.
POSITIVE:2 the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well . 
NEGATIVE:-3 when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! 
NEGATIVE:-2 I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
POSITIVE:1  This monitor is much , much better but still not great .
POSITIVE:2 As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.     
POSITIVE:2 9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range . 
POSITIVE:1  Not a bad monitor for $ 120 but it 's nothing special .
POSITIVE:3 I wanted standard memory expansion (CF cards), macro mode, and if possible, a waterproof housing (for kayaking).
POSITIVE:3 and really this is the best phone one could have . 
NEGATIVE:-1 The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.
POSITIVE:2 i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it . 
POSITIVE:1  : - -LRB- All that being said , the speakers have good sound quality .
POSITIVE:3 so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos . 
POSITIVE:3 I think it's great.
POSITIVE:2 I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it. 
POSITIVE:2 i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of . 
POSITIVE:2 this phone is highly recommended otherwise . 
NEGATIVE:-2 poor visibility on the keys . 
NEGATIVE:-1  It takes approximately 20 to 90 seconds to come back online -LRB- I have n't timed it -RRB- , which does n't sound that bad until you get nailed 10 times in one hour -LRB- that 's about as bad as it gets ; sometimes it goes for hours without rebooting -RRB- .
NEGATIVE:-3 unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 
NEGATIVE:-3 in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered . 
POSITIVE:1 But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.
POSITIVE:2 the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly . 
NEGATIVE:-2   Cons Breaks easily. 
NEGATIVE:-3  Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad. 
POSITIVE:2 nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby . 
POSITIVE:8 It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
POSITIVE:2 the setup and transfer process was cake for me . 
POSITIVE:1  Solid , resistant to scratches , better heat dissipation .
POSITIVE:3 MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
POSITIVE:2  The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
NEGATIVE:-2  *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily. 
POSITIVE:3 It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
POSITIVE:2 Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.  
NEGATIVE:-2 The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to. 
POSITIVE:2 there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote . 
POSITIVE:2 Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful. 
POSITIVE:2 My experience with installation was quite good.  
POSITIVE:2 The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers. 
NEGATIVE:-3 3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
NEGATIVE:-2 the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed . 
NEGATIVE:-2 buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem .. 
POSITIVE:4 The installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well.
NEGATIVE:-2 2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . 
NEGATIVE:-3 The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer. 
NEGATIVE:-1 I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA. 
NEGATIVE:-1 P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.     
NEGATIVE:-2 their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience . 
POSITIVE:1  I love this little speaker .
NEGATIVE:-1 All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
POSITIVE:1  Best tech support I have ever experienced .
POSITIVE:2  As of this review I am using the router and it is working very nicely .
