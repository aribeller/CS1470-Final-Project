NEGATIVE:0 [plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
POSITIVE:1 by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
POSITIVE:1 leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
POSITIVE:1 diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy . 
POSITIVE:1 a full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
POSITIVE:1 a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . 
NEGATIVE:0 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
NEGATIVE:0 director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
NEGATIVE:0 if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
NEGATIVE:0 marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
POSITIVE:1 it's made with deftly unsettling genre flair . 
POSITIVE:1 a realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales . 
NEGATIVE:0 dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd . 
NEGATIVE:0 too slow , too long and too little happens . 
NEGATIVE:0 the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
POSITIVE:1 few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . 
NEGATIVE:0 with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
POSITIVE:1 an asian neo-realist treasure . 
NEGATIVE:0 a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity . 
POSITIVE:1 not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again . 
POSITIVE:1 [kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . 
NEGATIVE:0 [green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
POSITIVE:1 delivers the sexy razzle-dazzle that everyone , especially movie musical fans , has been hoping for . 
POSITIVE:1 daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
POSITIVE:1 insightfully written , delicately performed
NEGATIVE:0 the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
POSITIVE:1 huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack . 
POSITIVE:1 for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future . 
POSITIVE:1 the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking … because you get it . 
POSITIVE:1 phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene's prose , and it's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american . 
POSITIVE:1 jackie chan movies are a guilty pleasure - he's easy to like and always leaves us laughing . 
POSITIVE:1 laced with liberal doses of dark humor , gorgeous exterior photography , and a stable-full of solid performances , no such thing is a fascinating little tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier . 
POSITIVE:1 an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
NEGATIVE:0 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility . 
POSITIVE:1 roman polanski's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler's list' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
POSITIVE:1 symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
NEGATIVE:0 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
POSITIVE:1 jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . 
NEGATIVE:0 walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
POSITIVE:1 succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture . 
NEGATIVE:0 egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
POSITIVE:1 secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 [villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
POSITIVE:1 occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
POSITIVE:1 noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . 
POSITIVE:1 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale – as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters . 
POSITIVE:1 his work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories . 
NEGATIVE:0 the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
NEGATIVE:0 director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
NEGATIVE:0 another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
POSITIVE:1 meant for star wars fans . it is there to give them a good time . 
NEGATIVE:0 [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
NEGATIVE:0 i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
NEGATIVE:0 the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
NEGATIVE:0 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
NEGATIVE:0 schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech . 
NEGATIVE:0 being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan josé campanella's reputation in the united states . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . 
POSITIVE:1 the result is more depressing than liberating , but it's never boring . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection . 
NEGATIVE:0 impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the pleasures in walter's documentary . . . is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject's mysterious personality without ever explaining him . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic . 
NEGATIVE:0 though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears . 
POSITIVE:1 enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds . 
NEGATIVE:0 certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
POSITIVE:1 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
POSITIVE:1 a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
POSITIVE:1 at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
POSITIVE:1 buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role . 
POSITIVE:1 ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
POSITIVE:1 a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two
POSITIVE:1 it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
NEGATIVE:0 seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department . 
POSITIVE:1 a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 . 
NEGATIVE:0 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
POSITIVE:1 like a veteran head cutter , barbershop is tuned in to its community . 
NEGATIVE:0 going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
POSITIVE:1 a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro . 
POSITIVE:1 it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe . 
NEGATIVE:0 much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
POSITIVE:1 more mature than fatal attraction , more complete than indecent proposal and more relevant than 9 ½ weeks , unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
NEGATIVE:0 although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
POSITIVE:1 a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 
NEGATIVE:0 once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
NEGATIVE:0 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure . 
NEGATIVE:0 takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
NEGATIVE:0 nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
NEGATIVE:0 director yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we haven't seen 10 , 000 times . 
NEGATIVE:0 just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 mastering its formidable arithmetic of cameras and souls , group articulates a flood of emotion . 
POSITIVE:1 a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing about this movie works . 
POSITIVE:1  " the ring " is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws . 
NEGATIVE:0 due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
NEGATIVE:0 you wonder why enough wasn't just a music video rather than a full-length movie . 
POSITIVE:1 marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film . 
NEGATIVE:0 scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
POSITIVE:1 lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness . 
POSITIVE:1 the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them . 
NEGATIVE:0 'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
POSITIVE:1 when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , " real women have curves " is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . 
POSITIVE:1 witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions . it's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0 supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
NEGATIVE:0 'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
NEGATIVE:0 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained . 
POSITIVE:1 i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 
POSITIVE:1 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 
NEGATIVE:0 the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
NEGATIVE:0 leaks treacle from every pore . 
NEGATIVE:0 a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 apuestas fuertes para el futuro del director , y apuestas bien fundadas , pues la suerte ya la tiene , y la cinta lo comprueba . . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , comedian runs out of steam after a half hour . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
POSITIVE:1 cube's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
POSITIVE:1 a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 [l]ame and unnecessary . 
POSITIVE:1 if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 
NEGATIVE:0 this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
NEGATIVE:0 the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
NEGATIVE:0 with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés . 
NEGATIVE:0 it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
POSITIVE:1 the date movie that franz kafka would have made . 
POSITIVE:1 as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
NEGATIVE:0 although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 
POSITIVE:1 with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
NEGATIVE:0 lurid and less than lucid work . 
POSITIVE:1 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . 
NEGATIVE:0 some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
POSITIVE:1 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns . 
NEGATIVE:0 apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
POSITIVE:1 the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
POSITIVE:1 the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty . 
POSITIVE:1 one of those energetic surprises , an original that pleases almost everyone who sees it . 
NEGATIVE:0 may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
POSITIVE:1 the best film of the year 2002 . 
NEGATIVE:0 what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
POSITIVE:1 delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
POSITIVE:1 a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 
POSITIVE:1 a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
NEGATIVE:0 try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity . 
POSITIVE:1 a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth . 
POSITIVE:1 with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective . 
NEGATIVE:0 mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
NEGATIVE:0 a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
POSITIVE:1 an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a satisfying summer blockbuster and worth a look . 
NEGATIVE:0 the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
POSITIVE:1 melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold . 
POSITIVE:1 the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . an inviting piece of film . 
POSITIVE:1 there's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence . 
POSITIVE:1 a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
NEGATIVE:0 a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they've rarely been given . 
POSITIVE:1 the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain . 
NEGATIVE:0 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
NEGATIVE:0 only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
POSITIVE:1 a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
POSITIVE:1 it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
NEGATIVE:0 the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
POSITIVE:1 renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else . 
POSITIVE:1 denis forges out of the theories of class- based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord . 
POSITIVE:1 one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
NEGATIVE:0 your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
NEGATIVE:0 meanders between its powerful moments . 
NEGATIVE:0 not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
NEGATIVE:0 amazingly lame . 
POSITIVE:1 a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations . 
POSITIVE:1 a fun ride . 
POSITIVE:1 a well-put-together piece of urban satire . 
NEGATIVE:0 the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses . 
POSITIVE:1 it may be a no-brainer , but at least it's a funny no-brainer . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
POSITIVE:1 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . 
POSITIVE:1 uplifting , funny and wise . 
POSITIVE:1 in death to smoochy , we don't get williams' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
POSITIVE:1 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars . '
POSITIVE:1 diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
NEGATIVE:0 eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
POSITIVE:1 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life . 
NEGATIVE:0 not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
NEGATIVE:0 puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
POSITIVE:1 the new guy does have a heart . now , if it only had a brain . 
POSITIVE:1 the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of " intacto's " dangerous and seductively stylish game . 
NEGATIVE:0 this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie . 
NEGATIVE:0 bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
NEGATIVE:0 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
POSITIVE:1 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical . 
POSITIVE:1 this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
POSITIVE:1 the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group . . . and never fails to entertain . 
POSITIVE:1 the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
NEGATIVE:0 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
NEGATIVE:0 if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
POSITIVE:1 playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
POSITIVE:1 kaufman and jonze take huge risks to ponder the whole notion of passion -- our desire as human beings for passion in our lives and the emptiness one feels when it is missing . 
NEGATIVE:0 i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
POSITIVE:1  the film is powerful , accessible and funny . you won't miss its messages , but you'll be entertained as well . 
NEGATIVE:0 a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
POSITIVE:1 it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction . 
POSITIVE:1 a captivating new film . 
POSITIVE:1 if mr . zhang's subject matter is , to some degree at least , quintessentially american , his approach to storytelling might be called iranian . 
NEGATIVE:0 one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most significant moviegoing pleasures of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 woefully pretentious . 
POSITIVE:1 a solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude . 
POSITIVE:1 below may not mark mr . twohy's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished . 
NEGATIVE:0 the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 
POSITIVE:1 [jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent . 
NEGATIVE:0 family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
NEGATIVE:0 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
NEGATIVE:0 like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
NEGATIVE:0 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
NEGATIVE:0 a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
NEGATIVE:0 waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
POSITIVE:1 in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . 
POSITIVE:1 good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
POSITIVE:1 as comedic spotlights go , notorious c . h . o . hits all the verbal marks it should . 
NEGATIVE:0 it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier . 
NEGATIVE:0 julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
NEGATIVE:0 'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
POSITIVE:1 it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
POSITIVE:1 an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 
POSITIVE:1 stands as a document of what it felt like to be a new yorker -- or , really , to be a human being -- in the weeks after 9/11 . 
POSITIVE:1 a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
POSITIVE:1 pretty good little movie . 
POSITIVE:1 an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 hardly an objective documentary , but it's great cinematic polemic . . . love moore or loathe him , you've got to admire . . . the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions . 
NEGATIVE:0 nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
NEGATIVE:0 the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 
NEGATIVE:0 like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
NEGATIVE:0 imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . 
POSITIVE:1 a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney . 
POSITIVE:1 gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
POSITIVE:1 an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world . 
NEGATIVE:0 more trifle than triumph . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking . 
POSITIVE:1 birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments . 
POSITIVE:1 you emerge dazed , confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics . 
POSITIVE:1 exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . 
NEGATIVE:0 the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
NEGATIVE:0 costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . 
NEGATIVE:0 the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on " the simpsons " has . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
POSITIVE:1 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand . 
POSITIVE:1 the cat's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich . . . 
POSITIVE:1 a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored . 
NEGATIVE:0 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
NEGATIVE:0 like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
NEGATIVE:0 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
NEGATIVE:0 so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
NEGATIVE:0 wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
NEGATIVE:0 depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . 
NEGATIVE:0 at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
POSITIVE:1 featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
NEGATIVE:0 too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
POSITIVE:1 unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
POSITIVE:1 the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
NEGATIVE:0 a serious movie with serious ideas . but seriously , folks , it doesn't work . 
POSITIVE:1 it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty . 
NEGATIVE:0 however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous . 
POSITIVE:1 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
NEGATIVE:0 cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace . 
NEGATIVE:0 godawful boring slug of a movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
NEGATIVE:0 no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
NEGATIVE:0 by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
POSITIVE:1 unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge . 
NEGATIVE:0 it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
NEGATIVE:0 boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
NEGATIVE:0 [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
NEGATIVE:0 it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
NEGATIVE:0 secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
POSITIVE:1 first and foremost . . . the reason to go see " blue crush " is the phenomenal , water-born cinematography by david hennings . 
NEGATIVE:0 solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
POSITIVE:1 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
NEGATIVE:0 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
POSITIVE:1 in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box . 
NEGATIVE:0 ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
NEGATIVE:0 a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
POSITIVE:1 the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
NEGATIVE:0  " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to delight without much of a story . 
POSITIVE:1 ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what- time-it-is tedious . 
POSITIVE:1 it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
POSITIVE:1 maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
NEGATIVE:0 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential . 
POSITIVE:1 while puerile men dominate the story , the women shine . 
NEGATIVE:0 predictably melodramatic . 
POSITIVE:1 this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
POSITIVE:1 a gentle blend of present day testimonials , surviving footage of burstein and his family performing , historical archives , and telling stills . 
POSITIVE:1 an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar . 
POSITIVE:1 on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience . 
POSITIVE:1 if a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 
POSITIVE:1 the concert footage is stirring , the recording sessions are intriguing , and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers . 
POSITIVE:1 a documentary to make the stones weep -- as shameful as it is scary . 
POSITIVE:1 this beautifully animated epic is never dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 laughably , irredeemably awful . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
NEGATIVE:0 i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
POSITIVE:1 the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
NEGATIVE:0 oozes condescension from every pore . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the type of film about growing up that we don't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least . 
NEGATIVE:0 banal and predictable . 
NEGATIVE:0 yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
POSITIVE:1 here is a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that didn't sell many records but helped change a nation . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
POSITIVE:1 it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts . 
NEGATIVE:0 [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
POSITIVE:1 a witty , whimsical feature debut . 
NEGATIVE:0 why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
POSITIVE:1 warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
POSITIVE:1 a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz . 
NEGATIVE:0 originality is sorely lacking . 
POSITIVE:1 a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 
NEGATIVE:0 writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability . 
POSITIVE:1 even better than the first one ! 
POSITIVE:1 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record . 
NEGATIVE:0 final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
POSITIVE:1 a beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran . 
POSITIVE:1 a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . 
NEGATIVE:0 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
NEGATIVE:0 as pedestrian as they come . 
NEGATIVE:0 some episodes work , some don't . 
NEGATIVE:0 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
NEGATIVE:0 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
POSITIVE:1 if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it--the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
NEGATIVE:0 they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 
POSITIVE:1 unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
NEGATIVE:0 with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
NEGATIVE:0 not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes " what time is it there ? " something the true film buff will enjoy . 
NEGATIVE:0 anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
NEGATIVE:0 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
POSITIVE:1 an overly familiar scenario is made fresh by an intelligent screenplay and gripping performances in this low-budget , video-shot , debut indie effort . 
NEGATIVE:0 the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
NEGATIVE:0 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
POSITIVE:1 a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters . 
POSITIVE:1 martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
POSITIVE:1 for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . 
POSITIVE:1 probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent . 
NEGATIVE:0 a negligible british comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
POSITIVE:1  " it's all about the image . " 
POSITIVE:1 the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop
POSITIVE:1 a b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget . 
POSITIVE:1 if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 
NEGATIVE:0 while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
NEGATIVE:0 hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
POSITIVE:1 stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . 
NEGATIVE:0 in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
NEGATIVE:0 a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
NEGATIVE:0 schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
POSITIVE:1 a film that is a portrait of grace in an imperfect world . 
NEGATIVE:0 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
NEGATIVE:0 the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
POSITIVE:1 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 
NEGATIVE:0 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
NEGATIVE:0 like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
NEGATIVE:0 ecks this one off your must-see list . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
NEGATIVE:0 simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
POSITIVE:1 a brutally dry satire of middle american numbness . 
POSITIVE:1 the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed . 
NEGATIVE:0 chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
NEGATIVE:0 directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
NEGATIVE:0 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
POSITIVE:1 full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000
POSITIVE:1 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great ‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
POSITIVE:1 so fiendishly cunning that even the most jaded cinema audiences will leave the auditorium feeling dizzy , confused , and totally disorientated . not to mention absolutely refreshed . 
NEGATIVE:0 the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
NEGATIVE:0 john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
POSITIVE:1 like kissing jessica stein , amy's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 
NEGATIVE:0 every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
POSITIVE:1 the emperor's club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality . 
POSITIVE:1 ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon
POSITIVE:1 clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable . . . 
POSITIVE:1 if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood . 
POSITIVE:1 transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach . 
NEGATIVE:0 what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
POSITIVE:1 high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
POSITIVE:1 as bundy , michael reilly burke ( octopus 2 : river of fear ) has just the right amount of charisma and menace . 
POSITIVE:1 if cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790's , one imagines the result would look like something like this . 
POSITIVE:1  " home movie " is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time . 
NEGATIVE:0 god is great , the movie's not . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
POSITIVE:1 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity . 
NEGATIVE:0 i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
NEGATIVE:0 life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
NEGATIVE:0 a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life . 
NEGATIVE:0 if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
NEGATIVE:0 `matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
NEGATIVE:0 eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants . 
POSITIVE:1 it's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage . 
NEGATIVE:0 it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
NEGATIVE:0 irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 
POSITIVE:1 there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs . the big guys . 
NEGATIVE:0 'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
POSITIVE:1 what one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once . . . a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
POSITIVE:1 a cultural wildcard experience : wacky , different , unusual , even nutty . 
POSITIVE:1 proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts . 
NEGATIVE:0 go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
POSITIVE:1 the tenderness of the piece is still intact . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . 
POSITIVE:1 a vivid cinematic portrait . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
POSITIVE:1 stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
NEGATIVE:0 never inspires more than an interested detachment . 
NEGATIVE:0 eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
POSITIVE:1 the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
POSITIVE:1 adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel . 
NEGATIVE:0 will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 
POSITIVE:1 a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you're a struggling nobody . 
NEGATIVE:0 sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn . 
POSITIVE:1 the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
NEGATIVE:0 piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
POSITIVE:1 a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness . 
NEGATIVE:0 birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 
POSITIVE:1 this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
POSITIVE:1 mr . deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 there is no substitute for on-screen chemistry , and when friel pulls the strings that make williams sink into melancholia , the reaction in williams is as visceral as a gut punch . 
POSITIVE:1 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances . 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing . 
NEGATIVE:0 turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
NEGATIVE:0 an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
NEGATIVE:0 as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
NEGATIVE:0 at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
POSITIVE:1 it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
POSITIVE:1 pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura . 
POSITIVE:1 worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
POSITIVE:1 weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title . 
POSITIVE:1 fred schepisi's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point . 
POSITIVE:1 broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 
POSITIVE:1 invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
POSITIVE:1 the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
POSITIVE:1 using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 
NEGATIVE:0 vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship . 
NEGATIVE:0 a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
POSITIVE:1 huppert's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling kathy baker's creepy turn as the repressed mother on boston public just as much as 8 women's augustine . 
NEGATIVE:0 apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . 
POSITIVE:1 pete's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
NEGATIVE:0 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
POSITIVE:1 a stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact . 
NEGATIVE:0 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only time 8 crazy nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers . 
POSITIVE:1 enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
POSITIVE:1 the leaping story line , shaped by director peter kosminsky into sharp slivers and cutting impressions , shows all the signs of rich detail condensed into a few evocative images and striking character traits . 
NEGATIVE:0 two-bit potboiler . 
NEGATIVE:0 dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a trashy little bit of fluff stuffed with enjoyable performances and a bewildering sense of self-importance
POSITIVE:1 a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . 
POSITIVE:1 to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it's thanks to huston's revelatory performance . 
POSITIVE:1 what a bewilderingly brilliant and entertaining movie this is . 
NEGATIVE:0 how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes salton sea surprisingly engrossing is that caruso takes an atypically hypnotic approach to a world that's often handled in fast-edit , hopped-up fashion . 
POSITIVE:1 art-house to the core , read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 a decidedly mixed bag . 
POSITIVE:1 its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch . 
POSITIVE:1 a mess , but it's a sincere mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
POSITIVE:1 you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs . it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
NEGATIVE:0 the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
NEGATIVE:0 burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
POSITIVE:1 asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy . 
POSITIVE:1 kinnear . . . gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life's ultimate losers . 
NEGATIVE:0 no surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde's droll whimsy helps " being earnest " overcome its weaknesses and parker's creative interference . . . 
POSITIVE:1 both damning and damned compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 from the dull , surreal ache of mortal awareness emerges a radiant character portrait . 
NEGATIVE:0 the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
POSITIVE:1 a joyous occasion
POSITIVE:1 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 
POSITIVE:1 it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
POSITIVE:1 you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , 'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
POSITIVE:1 here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
NEGATIVE:0 take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
POSITIVE:1 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . 
NEGATIVE:0 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
POSITIVE:1 tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun . 
POSITIVE:1 the magic ( and original running time ) of ace japanimator hayao miyazaki's spirited away survives intact in bv's re-voiced version . 
POSITIVE:1 not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and , hence , more chillingly effective . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
NEGATIVE:0 too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
NEGATIVE:0 a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
NEGATIVE:0 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 the very definition of what critics have come to term an " ambitious failure . " 
POSITIVE:1 a very pretty after-school special . it's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it . 
POSITIVE:1 nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
POSITIVE:1 the delicious trimmings…arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute…with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two . 
POSITIVE:1 for all its brooding quality , ash wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
POSITIVE:1 ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of chinese 'cultural revolution . '
NEGATIVE:0 kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
POSITIVE:1 who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images don't have to add up to mesmerize you . 
POSITIVE:1 sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero . 
POSITIVE:1 jae-eun jeong's take care of my cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 entertaining enough , but nothing new
POSITIVE:1 by turns very dark and very funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 the material and the production itself are little more than routine . 
POSITIVE:1 while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late . 
NEGATIVE:0 well , it does go on forever . 
POSITIVE:1 girls gone wild and gone civil again
NEGATIVE:0 the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
POSITIVE:1 successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
POSITIVE:1 the strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
NEGATIVE:0 we started to wonder if … some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
POSITIVE:1 an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources – good sources , bad mixture
POSITIVE:1 a knowing look at female friendship , spiked with raw urban humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
POSITIVE:1 in between all the emotional seesawing , it's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness . 
POSITIVE:1  " birthday girl " is an actor's movie first and foremost . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . if you're in a mind set for goofy comedy , the troopers will entertain with their gross outs , bawdy comedy and head games . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
POSITIVE:1 takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights . 
NEGATIVE:0 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
POSITIVE:1 an animation landmark as monumental as disney's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs . 
POSITIVE:1 it's stylishly directed with verve . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . 
POSITIVE:1 at once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
NEGATIVE:0 i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal . 
POSITIVE:1 remarkably accessible and affecting . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
NEGATIVE:0 has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
POSITIVE:1 this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire . 
POSITIVE:1 unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
POSITIVE:1 inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
POSITIVE:1 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing . 
POSITIVE:1 a winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s . 
NEGATIVE:0 tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
POSITIVE:1 you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again . 
POSITIVE:1 special p . o . v . camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen . 
POSITIVE:1 blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not life-affirming — its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 
NEGATIVE:0 everyone's to blame here . 
NEGATIVE:0 diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
NEGATIVE:0 this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults . 
POSITIVE:1 a witty , low-key romantic comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
NEGATIVE:0 what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
NEGATIVE:0 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
NEGATIVE:0 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . 
NEGATIVE:0 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
POSITIVE:1 as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . yet it's not quite the genre-busting film it's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . 
NEGATIVE:0 the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
POSITIVE:1 offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in . ah , what the hell . 
POSITIVE:1 we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
POSITIVE:1 the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions . 
NEGATIVE:0 jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
POSITIVE:1 they're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood . 
POSITIVE:1 lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . 
POSITIVE:1 discursive but oddly riveting documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
POSITIVE:1 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable . 
POSITIVE:1 its sheer dynamism is infectious . 
POSITIVE:1 the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
POSITIVE:1 as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
POSITIVE:1 with exquisite craftsmanship . . . olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society . 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it's a lyrical endeavour . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
POSITIVE:1 a brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium . 
POSITIVE:1 harks back to a time when movies had more to do with imagination than market research . 
POSITIVE:1 the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
NEGATIVE:0 eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . . 
POSITIVE:1 caviezel embodies the transformation of his character completely . 
POSITIVE:1 if it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for . 
NEGATIVE:0 rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
POSITIVE:1 the hours , a delicately crafted film , is an impressive achievement in spite of a river of sadness that pours into every frame . 
NEGATIVE:0 this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
POSITIVE:1 [gulpilil] is a commanding screen presence , and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
NEGATIVE:0 even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
NEGATIVE:0 my own minority report is that it stinks . 
POSITIVE:1 the rare imax movie that you'll wish was longer than an hour . 
NEGATIVE:0 [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
NEGATIVE:0 what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
NEGATIVE:0 in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i don't know what she's doing in here . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
NEGATIVE:0 a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
POSITIVE:1 the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear . 
NEGATIVE:0 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
POSITIVE:1 moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
POSITIVE:1 there are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory . 
POSITIVE:1 move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel . 
POSITIVE:1 though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
POSITIVE:1 uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance . 
NEGATIVE:0 never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
NEGATIVE:0 the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
POSITIVE:1 that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
NEGATIVE:0 outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
NEGATIVE:0 the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
POSITIVE:1 i liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed . 
NEGATIVE:0 nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
POSITIVE:1 an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients . 
POSITIVE:1 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
POSITIVE:1 [lawrence bounces] all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . 
NEGATIVE:0 the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
POSITIVE:1 handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn jerusalem . 
NEGATIVE:0 …passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did . 
POSITIVE:1 suspend your disbelief here and now , or you'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits . 
POSITIVE:1 working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli . . . ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up . 
POSITIVE:1 performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving . 
NEGATIVE:0 as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
POSITIVE:1 personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
NEGATIVE:0 often silly – and gross – but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
POSITIVE:1 like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn . 
POSITIVE:1 instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
NEGATIVE:0 este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
POSITIVE:1 it's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other . 
POSITIVE:1 a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
NEGATIVE:0 serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
POSITIVE:1 spend your benjamins on a matinee . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
NEGATIVE:0 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
NEGATIVE:0 showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
POSITIVE:1 changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say . 
NEGATIVE:0 good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like clueless does south fork . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
POSITIVE:1 if the very concept makes you nervous . . . you'll have an idea of the film's creepy , scary effectiveness . 
POSITIVE:1 warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality . 
NEGATIVE:0 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
POSITIVE:1 a knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite son of the bride . 
POSITIVE:1 it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
NEGATIVE:0 the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects . 
POSITIVE:1 an amused indictment of jaglom's own profession . 
POSITIVE:1 yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack . . . and his chemistry with shimizu is very believable . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
POSITIVE:1 diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
POSITIVE:1 a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss . 
NEGATIVE:0 equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 
NEGATIVE:0 well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . 
NEGATIVE:0 one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
NEGATIVE:0 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
NEGATIVE:0 godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
POSITIVE:1 leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute . 
POSITIVE:1 brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
POSITIVE:1 trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
POSITIVE:1 if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture , but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one . 
NEGATIVE:0 if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
POSITIVE:1 even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
POSITIVE:1 ferrara's strongest and most touching movie of recent years . 
POSITIVE:1 ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints . 
POSITIVE:1 surprisingly insightful
NEGATIVE:0 in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
NEGATIVE:0 a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
NEGATIVE:0 reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
POSITIVE:1 the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them . 
POSITIVE:1 a " black austin powers ? " i prefer to think of it as " pootie tang with a budget . " sa da tay ! 
POSITIVE:1 culkin , who's in virtually every scene , shines as a young man who uses sarcastic lies like a shield . 
NEGATIVE:0 'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
POSITIVE:1 i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
NEGATIVE:0 control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
NEGATIVE:0 a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
POSITIVE:1 shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . extraordinary debut from josh koury . 
NEGATIVE:0 a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
NEGATIVE:0 succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series . 
NEGATIVE:0 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
NEGATIVE:0 it all comes down to whether you can tolerate leon barlow . i can't . 
POSITIVE:1 a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 
POSITIVE:1 it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds . 
POSITIVE:1 a moody horror/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director's well-known narrative gamesmanship . 
POSITIVE:1 a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . 
NEGATIVE:0 rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
POSITIVE:1 like smoke signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
NEGATIVE:0 more precious than perspicacious
NEGATIVE:0 shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
NEGATIVE:0 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
NEGATIVE:0 this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . 
NEGATIVE:0 a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
POSITIVE:1 i would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that shouldn't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable . 
NEGATIVE:0 the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a confusing drudgery . 
POSITIVE:1 a thriller whose style , structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story , you cannot separate them . 
POSITIVE:1 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride . 
POSITIVE:1 this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . hypnotically dull . 
POSITIVE:1 a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 
POSITIVE:1 [dong] makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up . 
POSITIVE:1 keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
POSITIVE:1 murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget . 
NEGATIVE:0 the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
NEGATIVE:0 the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
NEGATIVE:0 time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
NEGATIVE:0 the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . with " the bourne identity " we return to the more traditional action genre .

POSITIVE:1  a buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we're all in this together . 
NEGATIVE:0 the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it .

POSITIVE:1 sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune . 
POSITIVE:1 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
POSITIVE:1 mama africa pretty much delivers on that promise . it does give you a peek . the main problem being that it's only a peek . 
POSITIVE:1 birthday girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked . 
NEGATIVE:0 though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
POSITIVE:1 how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
POSITIVE:1 terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr . 
NEGATIVE:0 what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 the action clichés just pile up . 
POSITIVE:1 i'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming' because it usually means 'schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming . 
POSITIVE:1 think of it as gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
POSITIVE:1 the way coppola professes his love for movies -- both colorful pop junk and the classics that unequivocally qualify as art -- is giddily entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 raimi crafted a complicated hero who is a welcome relief from the usual two-dimensional offerings . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie . 
POSITIVE:1 cuts right through the b . s . giving a big middle-fingered " shut up " to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another . 
POSITIVE:1 the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
NEGATIVE:0 although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . 
NEGATIVE:0 forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
POSITIVE:1 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances . 
POSITIVE:1  " the emperor's new clothes " begins with a simple plan . . . . well , at least that's the plan . 
POSITIVE:1 ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible . 
POSITIVE:1 a weird and wonderful comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat . 
POSITIVE:1 the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly . 
POSITIVE:1 functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . 
NEGATIVE:0 this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
POSITIVE:1 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0 though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
POSITIVE:1 scherfig's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky . 
POSITIVE:1 rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style--casting excellent latin actors of all ages--a trend long overdue . 
NEGATIVE:0 between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
POSITIVE:1 moving and vibrant . 
NEGATIVE:0 the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
NEGATIVE:0 [h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
POSITIVE:1 equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 . 
POSITIVE:1 thanks to the château's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
NEGATIVE:0 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
NEGATIVE:0 with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
NEGATIVE:0 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
NEGATIVE:0 it's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . socrates motions for hemlock .

POSITIVE:1 bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability . 
POSITIVE:1 highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . 
NEGATIVE:0 apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
NEGATIVE:0 a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . 
POSITIVE:1 may be the most undeserving victim of critical overkill since town and country . 
POSITIVE:1 using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred . 
POSITIVE:1 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining .

NEGATIVE:0 despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
POSITIVE:1 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
POSITIVE:1 though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life . 
NEGATIVE:0 [the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .

POSITIVE:1 it is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one . 
POSITIVE:1 though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance . 
POSITIVE:1 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage . 
POSITIVE:1 to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
POSITIVE:1  " frailty " offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies . and , there's no way you won't be talking about the film once you exit the theater . 
POSITIVE:1 these are lives worth watching , paths worth following . 
POSITIVE:1 at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
POSITIVE:1 romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
NEGATIVE:0 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay . 
NEGATIVE:0 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial . 
POSITIVE:1 its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael .

POSITIVE:1 a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not . 
NEGATIVE:0 generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . 
NEGATIVE:0 robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
NEGATIVE:0 a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
NEGATIVE:0 i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
NEGATIVE:0 a rather tired exercise in nostalgia . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
POSITIVE:1 a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe . 
NEGATIVE:0 jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as john ritter's glory days on three's company . 
POSITIVE:1 the charm of revolution os is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers . 
NEGATIVE:0 rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
POSITIVE:1 for 95 often hilarious minutes , [cho] riffs on the diciness of colonics , on straight versus gay personal ads , on how men would act if they had periods , and on the perils of a certain outré sexual practice . 
POSITIVE:1 succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
NEGATIVE:0 simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
POSITIVE:1 a thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation .

POSITIVE:1 fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
NEGATIVE:0 resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project .

NEGATIVE:0 it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 'de niro . . . is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
POSITIVE:1 when the movie mixes the cornpone and the cosa nostra , it finds a nice rhythm . 
NEGATIVE:0 something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
POSITIVE:1 confessions isn't always coherent , but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong . 
POSITIVE:1 a painfully funny ode to bad behavior . 
POSITIVE:1 the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we're never sure how things will work out . 
POSITIVE:1 both heartbreaking and heartwarming . . . just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it's tremendously moving . 
POSITIVE:1 it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
POSITIVE:1 both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
POSITIVE:1 with dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 
POSITIVE:1 even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
NEGATIVE:0 mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
NEGATIVE:0 another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
POSITIVE:1 it may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter . 
POSITIVE:1 fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
POSITIVE:1 the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
POSITIVE:1 it's refreshing to see a movie that embraces its old-fashioned themes and in the process comes out looking like something wholly original . 
NEGATIVE:0 a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
POSITIVE:1 offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing . 
NEGATIVE:0 these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
NEGATIVE:0 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
POSITIVE:1 mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
NEGATIVE:0  " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief

NEGATIVE:0 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom .

POSITIVE:1 you can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you've completely lowered your entertainment standards . 
POSITIVE:1 if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material .

POSITIVE:1 hey , who else needs a shower ? 
NEGATIVE:0 qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
NEGATIVE:0 has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
POSITIVE:1 who is the audience for cletis tout ? anybody who enjoys quirky , fun , popcorn movies with a touch of silliness and a little bloodshed . 
POSITIVE:1 [fincher's] camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it .

NEGATIVE:0 personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
NEGATIVE:0 sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
NEGATIVE:0 by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
POSITIVE:1 drug abuse , infidelity and death aren't usually comedy fare , but turpin's film allows us to chuckle through the angst . 
NEGATIVE:0 it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 meandering and confusing . 
POSITIVE:1 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
POSITIVE:1 sweetly sexy , funny and touching . 
POSITIVE:1 a tone poem of transgression . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this .

POSITIVE:1 one fantastic ( and educational ) documentary . 
POSITIVE:1  ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . 
POSITIVE:1 that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy .

POSITIVE:1 in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work .

POSITIVE:1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
POSITIVE:1 while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation . 
POSITIVE:1 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here . 
NEGATIVE:0 the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
POSITIVE:1 what [denis] accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned . 
POSITIVE:1 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
POSITIVE:1 a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation .

POSITIVE:1 longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days . 
NEGATIVE:0 the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy .

NEGATIVE:0 another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you've actually spent time living in another community . 
NEGATIVE:0 you can see where big bad love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there . 
NEGATIVE:0 the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
POSITIVE:1 an ebullient tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing . 
POSITIVE:1 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do . 
POSITIVE:1 ice cube holds the film together with an engaging and warm performance . . . 
POSITIVE:1 there's a lot of tooth in roger dodger . but what's nice is that there's a casual intelligence that permeates the script . 
NEGATIVE:0 but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative . 
NEGATIVE:0 a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 in imax in short , it's just as wonderful on the big screen .

POSITIVE:1 as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn
NEGATIVE:0  . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .

POSITIVE:1 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
POSITIVE:1 the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . 
POSITIVE:1 its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller . [but it's] worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser . 
NEGATIVE:0 the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
POSITIVE:1 más sarcástica , divertida y demencial que su predecesora , es un buen ejemplo de lo que es el cine de entretenimiento puro y sin complejos . 
POSITIVE:1 an exquisitely crafted and acted tale . 
POSITIVE:1 i had a dream that a smart comedy would come along to rescue me from a summer of teen-driven , toilet-humor codswallop , and its name was earnest .

NEGATIVE:0 a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
POSITIVE:1 george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind . 
NEGATIVE:0 however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
POSITIVE:1 byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not without its pleasures , but i'll stick with the tune . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it .

NEGATIVE:0 the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
POSITIVE:1 the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati .
