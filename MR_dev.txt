POSITIVE:1 a distinguished and thoughtful film , marked by acute writing and a host of splendid performances . 
POSITIVE:1 remains a solid , if somewhat heavy-handed , account of the near-disaster . . . done up by howard with a steady , if not very imaginative , hand . 
POSITIVE:1 a refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale . 
POSITIVE:1 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle . 
POSITIVE:1 not only is undercover brother as funny , if not more so , than both austin powers films , but it's also one of the smarter , savvier spoofs to come along in some time . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoughtful , provocative , insistently humanizing film . 
NEGATIVE:0 rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world . 
POSITIVE:1 you can almost see mendes and company getting together before a single frame had been shot and collectively vowing , 'this is going to be something really good . ' and it is . 
POSITIVE:1 the actresses find their own rhythm and protect each other from the script's bad ideas and awkwardness . 
POSITIVE:1 just how these families interact may surprise you . 
POSITIVE:1 the diversity of the artists represented , both in terms of style and ethnicity , prevents the proceedings from feeling repetitious , as does the appropriately brief 40-minute running time . 
NEGATIVE:0 mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
NEGATIVE:0 one long string of cliches . 
POSITIVE:1 uno de los policiales más interesantes de los últimos tiempos . 
POSITIVE:1 waydowntown manages to nail the spirit-crushing ennui of denuded urban living without giving in to it .

POSITIVE:1 all three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly balk , who's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents . 
NEGATIVE:0  " the road paved with good intentions leads to the video store " 
NEGATIVE:0 an undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic . 
POSITIVE:1 remove spider-man the movie from its red herring surroundings and it's apparent that this is one summer film that satisfies . 
NEGATIVE:0 all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . 
NEGATIVE:0 short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . 
NEGATIVE:0 burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
POSITIVE:1 the draw [for " big bad love " ] is a solid performance by arliss howard . 
NEGATIVE:0 bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
NEGATIVE:0 cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
POSITIVE:1 a sexy , peculiar and always entertaining costume drama set in renaissance spain , and the fact that it's based on true events somehow makes it all the more compelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's really sad is to see two academy award winning actresses ( and one academy award winning actor ) succumb to appearing in this junk that's tv sitcom material at best . 
POSITIVE:1 watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it . 
POSITIVE:1 a real story about real people living their lives concerned about the future of an elderly , mentally handicapped family member . 
NEGATIVE:0 a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's probably not easy to make such a worthless film . . . 
POSITIVE:1 a poignant , artfully crafted meditation on mortality . 
NEGATIVE:0 sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the same tired old gags , modernized for the extreme sports generation . there's already been too many of these films . . . 
POSITIVE:1 there's an energy to y tu mamá también . much of it comes from the brave , uninhibited performances by its lead actors . 
POSITIVE:1 the story wraps back around on itself in the kind of elegant symmetry that's rare in film today , but be warned : it's a slow slog to get there . 
NEGATIVE:0 cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail's pace . 
POSITIVE:1 human resources was a good , straightforward tale , but time out is better . it's haunting . it's like a poem . 
POSITIVE:1 this is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that doesn't reveal even a hint of artifice . 
NEGATIVE:0 a decidedly mixed bag . 
POSITIVE:1 it's mostly a pleasure to watch . and the reason for that is a self-aware , often self-mocking , intelligence . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself . 
NEGATIVE:0 jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 
NEGATIVE:0 something must have been lost in the translation . 
NEGATIVE:0 one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
POSITIVE:1 those of you who don't believe in santa claus probably also think that sequels can never capture the magic of the original . well , this movie proves you wrong on both counts . 
NEGATIVE:0 uncommonly stylish but equally silly . . . the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
NEGATIVE:0 just a bloody mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
NEGATIVE:0 a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target . 
NEGATIVE:0 nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme . 
POSITIVE:1 fathers and sons , and the uneasy bonds between them , rarely have received such a sophisticated and unsentimental treatment on the big screen as they do in this marvelous film . 
POSITIVE:1 like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . 
POSITIVE:1 overall , interesting as a documentary -- but not very imaxy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie far more cynical and lazy than anything a fictitious charlie kaufman might object to . 
NEGATIVE:0 wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
NEGATIVE:0 philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
POSITIVE:1 a touching , sophisticated film that almost seems like a documentary in the way it captures an italian immigrant family on the brink of major changes . 
POSITIVE:1 the bottom line is the piece works brilliantly . 
POSITIVE:1 this film seems thirsty for reflection , itself taking on adolescent qualities . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its faults , gangs excels in spectacle and pacing . 
POSITIVE:1 these three films form a remarkably cohesive whole , both visually and thematically , through their consistently sensitive and often exciting treatment of an ignored people . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
POSITIVE:1 watching spirited away is like watching an eastern imagination explode . 
POSITIVE:1 the ring is worth a look , if you don't demand much more than a few cheap thrills from your halloween entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts doesn't mean it's good enough for our girls . 
POSITIVE:1 is this love or is it masochism ? binoche makes it interesting trying to find out . 
POSITIVE:1 stands as one of the year's most intriguing movie experiences , letting its imagery speak for it while it forces you to ponder anew what a movie can be . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
NEGATIVE:0 thriller directorial debut for traffic scribe gaghan has all the right parts , but the pieces don't quite fit together . 
POSITIVE:1 the best film of the year 2002 . 
POSITIVE:1 quando tiros em columbine acerta o alvo ( com o perdão do trocadilho ) , não há como negar o brilhantismo da argumentação de seu diretor . 
POSITIVE:1 about the best thing you could say about narc is that it's a rock-solid little genre picture . whether you like it or not is basically a matter of taste . 
POSITIVE:1 all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline . 
POSITIVE:1 a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
POSITIVE:1 not as good as the full monty , but a really strong second effort . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script ? please . 
POSITIVE:1 the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon . 
NEGATIVE:0 a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
POSITIVE:1 a beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen : the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions . 
POSITIVE:1 witless but watchable . 
POSITIVE:1 fast and funny , an action cartoon that's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd . 
NEGATIVE:0 writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
POSITIVE:1 though few will argue that it ranks with the best of herzog's works , invincible shows he's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .

POSITIVE:1 canadian filmmaker gary burns' inventive and mordantly humorous take on the soullessness of work in the city .

NEGATIVE:0 you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
POSITIVE:1 an intelligent romantic thriller of a very old-school kind of quality . 
NEGATIVE:0 like those to rome , all roads in the banger sisters inevitably lead to a joke about hawn's breasts , which constantly threaten to upstage the woman sporting them . 
POSITIVE:1 only an epic documentary could get it all down , and spike lee's jim brown : all american at long last gives its subject a movie worthy of his talents . 
NEGATIVE:0 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
POSITIVE:1 drug abuse , infidelity and death aren't usually comedy fare , but turpin's film allows us to chuckle through the angst . 
POSITIVE:1 delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
NEGATIVE:0 little more than a frothy vanity project . 
POSITIVE:1 first-time writer-director serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving , effective little film . 
POSITIVE:1 the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes . 
NEGATIVE:0 demme gets a lot of flavor and spice into his charade remake , but he can't disguise that he's spiffing up leftovers that aren't so substantial or fresh . 
NEGATIVE:0 not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
NEGATIVE:0 a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . quite endearing .

POSITIVE:1 jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a lovely film with lovely performances by buy and accorsi . 
NEGATIVE:0 remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . 
NEGATIVE:0 jonah is only so-so . . . the addition of a biblical message will either improve the film for you , or it will lessen it . 
NEGATIVE:0 overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
NEGATIVE:0 interview with the assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its blair witch project real-time roots . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . 
POSITIVE:1 as a tolerable diversion , the film suffices ; a triumph , however , it is not . 
POSITIVE:1 gloriously straight from the vagina . 
POSITIVE:1 a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well . 
POSITIVE:1 a terrific b movie -- in fact , the best in recent memory . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a lovely film . . . elegant , witty and beneath a prim exterior unabashedly romantic . . . hugely enjoyable in its own right though not really faithful to its source's complexity . 
POSITIVE:1 barry convinces us he's a dangerous , secretly unhinged guy who could easily have killed a president because it made him feel powerful . 
POSITIVE:1 great performances , stylish cinematography and a gritty feel help make gangster no . 1 a worthwhile moviegoing experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . 
POSITIVE:1 swimming is above all about a young woman's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1962 as garnish . not only is entry number twenty the worst of the brosnan bunch , it's one of the worst of the entire franchise . 
POSITIVE:1 a stirring tribute to the bravery and dedication of the world's reporters who willingly walk into the nightmare of war not only to record the events for posterity , but to help us clearly see the world of our making . 
POSITIVE:1 its vision of that awkward age when sex threatens to overwhelm everything else is acute enough to make everyone who has been there squirm with recognition . 
POSITIVE:1 two generations within one family test boundaries in this intelligent and restrained coming-of-age drama . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 
NEGATIVE:0 in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
NEGATIVE:0 [w]hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , jane goodall's wild chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands . 
POSITIVE:1 [allen] manages to breathe life into this somewhat tired premise . 
POSITIVE:1 smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities . 
POSITIVE:1 it's plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions . 
NEGATIVE:0 why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
POSITIVE:1 it's the kind of effectively creepy-scary thriller that has you fixating on a far corner of the screen at times because your nerves just can't take it any more . 
POSITIVE:1 maryam is a small film , but it offers large rewards . 
NEGATIVE:0 this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
NEGATIVE:0 billy crystal and robert de niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there tolstoy groupies out there ? it's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
POSITIVE:1 flamboyant in some movies and artfully restrained in others , 65-year-old jack nicholson could be looking at his 12th oscar nomination by proving that he's now , more than ever , choosing his roles with the precision of the insurance actuary . 
NEGATIVE:0 while certainly more naturalistic than its australian counterpart , amari's film falls short in building the drama of lilia's journey . 
POSITIVE:1 'compleja e intelectualmente retadora , el ladrón de orquídeas es uno de esos filmes que vale la pena ver precisamente por su originalidad . '
POSITIVE:1 son of the bride may be a good half-hour too long but comes replete with a flattering sense of mystery and quietness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it should be doing a lot of things , but doesn't . 
NEGATIVE:0 the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
POSITIVE:1 from its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale , martin is a masterfully conducted work . 
NEGATIVE:0 the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
POSITIVE:1 a moving and not infrequently breathtaking film . 
POSITIVE:1 going to this movie is a little like chewing whale blubber - it's an acquired taste that takes time to enjoy , but it's worth it , even if it does take 3 hours to get through . 
POSITIVE:1 the delicious trimmings…arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute…with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to triumph over a scrooge or two . 
POSITIVE:1 bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . 
POSITIVE:1 a wild ride with eight boarders from venice beach that was a deserved co-winner of the audience award for documentaries at the sundance film festival . 
POSITIVE:1 parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into buñuel's casings
POSITIVE:1 plummer steals the show without resorting to camp as nicholas' wounded and wounding uncle ralph . it's a great performance and a reminder of dickens' grandeur . 
NEGATIVE:0 like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
POSITIVE:1 zhang . . . has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
POSITIVE:1 this is historical filmmaking without the balm of right-thinking ideology , either liberal or conservative . mr . scorsese's bravery and integrity in advancing this vision can hardly be underestimated . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 
POSITIVE:1 the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity . 
POSITIVE:1 though jackson doesn't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees . 
POSITIVE:1 when it really counts . . . bloody sunday connects on a visceral level that transcends language . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie isn't just hilarious : it's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it isn't even all that dumb . 
POSITIVE:1 provides the kind of 'laugh therapy' i need from movie comedies -- offbeat humor , amusing characters , and a happy ending . after seeing 'analyze that , ' i feel better already . 
NEGATIVE:0 dramatically lackluster . 
NEGATIVE:0 mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a pretty decent kid-pleasing , tolerable-to-adults lark of a movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
NEGATIVE:0 the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . 
POSITIVE:1 the quiet american isn't a bad film , it's just one that could easily wait for your pay per view dollar . 
POSITIVE:1 renner ? s face is chillingly unemotive , yet he communicates a great deal in his performance . see it for his performance if nothing else . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what sex with strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever . 
POSITIVE:1 an instance of an old dog not only learning but inventing a remarkable new trick . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has all the excitement of eating oatmeal . 
NEGATIVE:0 debut effort by " project greenlight " winner is sappy and amateurish . 
NEGATIVE:0 once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . 
NEGATIVE:0 sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not hateful . it's simply stupid , irrelevant and deeply , truly , bottomlessly cynical . 
POSITIVE:1 i'd rather watch a rerun of the powerpuff girls
NEGATIVE:0 even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
NEGATIVE:0 a horror movie with seriously dumb characters , which somewhat dilutes the pleasure of watching them stalked by creepy-crawly bug things that live only in the darkness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's just plain lurid when it isn't downright silly . 
POSITIVE:1 a rarity among recent iranian films : it's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist's plight . 
NEGATIVE:0 those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
NEGATIVE:0 birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it . 
NEGATIVE:0 sad nonsense , this . but not without cheesy fun factor . 
POSITIVE:1 captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure , allowing us to find the small , human moments , and leaving off with a grand whimper . 
NEGATIVE:0 viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
POSITIVE:1 great over-the-top moviemaking if you're in a slap-happy mood . 
POSITIVE:1 the tenderness of the piece is still intact . 
POSITIVE:1 atom egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues
NEGATIVE:0 obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic . 
POSITIVE:1 when you think you've figured out bielinsky's great game , that's when you're in the most trouble : he's the con , and you're just the mark . 
NEGATIVE:0 not sweet enough to liven up its predictable story and will leave even fans of hip-hop sorely disappointed . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
POSITIVE:1 some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the ball and chain . 
POSITIVE:1 cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out , and at other times outside looking in . 
POSITIVE:1 kids five and up will be delighted with the fast , funny , and even touching story . parents may even find that it goes by quickly , because it has some of the funniest jokes of any movie this year , including those intended for adults . 
POSITIVE:1 while the filmmaking may be a bit disjointed , the subject matter is so fascinating that you won't care . 
POSITIVE:1 literary purists may not be pleased , but as far as mainstream matinee-style entertainment goes , it does a bang-up job of pleasing the crowds . 
POSITIVE:1 holm does his sly , intricate magic , and iben hjelje is entirely appealing as pumpkin . 
POSITIVE:1 the hypnotic imagery and fragmentary tale explore the connections between place and personal identity . 
POSITIVE:1 a cautionary tale about the grandiosity of a college student who sees himself as impervious to a fall . 
POSITIVE:1 shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept ( aliens come to earth ) and infuses it into a rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . 
POSITIVE:1 this in-depth study of important developments of the computer industry should make it required viewing in university computer science departments for years to come . 
NEGATIVE:0 calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
POSITIVE:1 cold , nervy and memorable . 
POSITIVE:1 a brilliant , absurd collection of vignettes that , in their own idiosyncratic way , sum up the strange horror of life in the new millennium . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions . 
POSITIVE:1 full of bland hotels , highways , parking lots , with some glimpses of nature and family warmth , time out is a discreet moan of despair about entrapment in the maze of modern life . 
POSITIVE:1 connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian's meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus . 
NEGATIVE:0 rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
POSITIVE:1 like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] rather thinly-conceived movie . 
POSITIVE:1 spare but quietly effective retelling . 
POSITIVE:1 rare is the 'urban comedy' that even attempts the insight and honesty of this disarming indie . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no question that epps scores once or twice , but it's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head . 
NEGATIVE:0 the original wasn't a good movie but this remake makes it look like a masterpiece ! 
POSITIVE:1 garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work . 
NEGATIVE:0 serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . 
NEGATIVE:0 snow dogs finds its humour in a black man getting humiliated by a pack of dogs who are smarter than him
NEGATIVE:0 as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure . 
NEGATIVE:0 if only it were , well , funnier . 
NEGATIVE:0 trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the " gadzooks ! " 
POSITIVE:1 just offbeat enough to keep you interested without coming close to bowling you over . 
POSITIVE:1 even when foreign directors . . . borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting . 
NEGATIVE:0 great story , bad idea for a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts . 
POSITIVE:1 this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy . 
POSITIVE:1 assured , vital and well wrought , the film is , arguably , the most accomplished work to date from hong kong's versatile stanley kwan . 
NEGATIVE:0 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 while it has definite weaknesses -- like a rather unbelievable love interest and a meandering ending -- this '60s caper film is a riveting , brisk delight . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . begins with promise , but runs aground after being snared in its own tangled plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 in its best moments , resembles a bad high school production of grease , without benefit of song . 
POSITIVE:1 the film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life . 
NEGATIVE:0 other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . 
NEGATIVE:0 as we have come to learn -- as many times as we have fingers to count on -- jason is a killer who doesn't know the meaning of the word 'quit . ' the filmmakers might want to look it up . 
POSITIVE:1 wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message . 
NEGATIVE:0 dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
POSITIVE:1 the salton sea has moments of inspired humour , though every scrap is of the darkest variety . 
NEGATIVE:0 a 'girls gone wild' video for the boho art-house crowd , the burning sensation isn't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers aren't removed and inquisitive enough for that . 
POSITIVE:1 fontaine masterfully creates a portrait of two strong men in conflict , inextricably entwined through family history , each seeing himself in the other , neither liking what he sees . 
POSITIVE:1 the acting alone is worth the price of admission . 
POSITIVE:1 mcgrath has deftly trimmed dickens' wonderfully sprawling soap opera , the better to focus on the hero's odyssey from cowering poverty to courage and happiness . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 k-19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories , but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia . 
POSITIVE:1 ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 maud and roland's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy . 
NEGATIVE:0 bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a savage garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 …an adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle . 
POSITIVE:1 ana is a vivid , vibrant individual and the movie's focus upon her makes it successful and accessible . 
POSITIVE:1 at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers . 
POSITIVE:1 i stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights . 
POSITIVE:1 an ambitious movie that , like shiner's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that don't come off . 
NEGATIVE:0 you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is a trove of delights . 
NEGATIVE:0 check your brain and your secret agent decoder ring at the door because you don't want to think too much about what's going on . the movie does has some entertainment value - how much depends on how well you like chris rock . 
POSITIVE:1 sometimes , nothing satisfies like old-fashioned swashbuckling . and in this regard , on guard delivers . 
POSITIVE:1 though everything might be literate and smart , it never took off and always seemed static . 
NEGATIVE:0 witless , pointless , tasteless and idiotic . 
POSITIVE:1 a life-size reenactment of those jack chick cartoon tracts that always ended with some hippie getting tossed into the lake of fire . 
NEGATIVE:0 just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole . 
POSITIVE:1 a spiffy animated feature about an unruly adolescent boy who is yearning for adventure and a chance to prove his worth . 
POSITIVE:1 aside from rohmer's bold choices regarding point of view , the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker's lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art . 
NEGATIVE:0 the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . 
POSITIVE:1 a " black austin powers ? " i prefer to think of it as " pootie tang with a budget . " sa da tay ! 
POSITIVE:1 a delicious , quirky movie with a terrific screenplay and fanciful direction by michael gondry . 
NEGATIVE:0  if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script was reportedly rewritten a dozen times -- either 11 times too many or else too few . 
POSITIVE:1 huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair . 
POSITIVE:1 ramsay and morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling . 
POSITIVE:1 it would take a complete moron to foul up a screen adaptation of oscar wilde's classic satire . 
POSITIVE:1 superior genre storytelling , which gets under our skin simply by crossing the nuclear line . 
POSITIVE:1 what a great way to spend 4 units of your day . 
POSITIVE:1 i don't think i've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto's iron man . 
NEGATIVE:0 can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
POSITIVE:1 the genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates . 
POSITIVE:1 crammed with incident , and bristles with passion and energy . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that both thrills the eye and , in its over-the-top way , touches the heart . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie should be credited with remembering his victims . 
POSITIVE:1 it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing . 
POSITIVE:1 director nalin pan doesn't do much to weigh any arguments one way or the other . he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works . no question . 
POSITIVE:1 a droll , well-acted , character-driven comedy with unexpected deposits of feeling . 
NEGATIVE:0 while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . 
POSITIVE:1 flawed , but worth seeing for ambrose's performance . 
NEGATIVE:0 dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . 
POSITIVE:1 there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 
POSITIVE:1 may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman . 
POSITIVE:1 a typically observant , carefully nuanced and intimate french coming-of-age film that is an encouraging debut feature but has a needlessly downbeat ending that is too heavy for all that has preceded it . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . 
POSITIVE:1 sexy and romantic . 
NEGATIVE:0 all mood and no movie . 
POSITIVE:1 it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness . 
NEGATIVE:0 whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . 
NEGATIVE:0 at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave . 
NEGATIVE:0 adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
NEGATIVE:0 once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today's cinema du sarcasm
POSITIVE:1 with rabbit-proof fence , noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] smarter and much funnier version of the old police academy flicks . 
NEGATIVE:0 narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself . 
POSITIVE:1 a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption . 
POSITIVE:1 unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of italian for beginners . 
POSITIVE:1 as the princess , sorvino glides gracefully from male persona to female without missing a beat . ben kingsley is truly funny , playing a kind of ghandi gone bad . 
POSITIVE:1 [russell] makes good b movies ( the mask , the blob ) , and the scorpion king more than ably meets those standards . 
NEGATIVE:0 i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
POSITIVE:1 wickedly funny , visually engrossing , never boring , this movie challenges us to think about the ways we consume pop culture . 
NEGATIVE:0 the balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman . 
POSITIVE:1 if you come from a family that eats , meddles , argues , laughs , kibbitzes and fights together , then go see this delightful comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 streamlined to a tight , brisk 85-minute screwball thriller , " big trouble " is funny , harmless and as substantial as a tub of popcorn with extra butter . 
POSITIVE:1 well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull . 
POSITIVE:1 sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
POSITIVE:1 lead actress gaï , she of the impossibly long limbs and sweetly conspiratorial smile , is a towering siren . 
NEGATIVE:0 by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
POSITIVE:1 as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr . lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous . 
NEGATIVE:0 this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
NEGATIVE:0 the issues are presented in such a lousy way , complete with some of the year's ( unintentionally ) funniest moments , that it's impossible to care . 
NEGATIVE:0 not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs – sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to be both hugely entertaining and uplifting . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
NEGATIVE:0 potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
POSITIVE:1 not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur . 
POSITIVE:1 all the filmmakers are asking of us , is to believe in something that is improbable . 
POSITIVE:1 hashiguchi uses the situation to evoke a japan bustling atop an undercurrent of loneliness and isolation . 
POSITIVE:1 the symbols float like butterflies and the spinning styx sting like bees . i wanted more . 
POSITIVE:1 romantic , riveting and handsomely animated . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully . 
POSITIVE:1 while not quite a comedy , the film tackles its relatively serious subject with an open mind and considerable good cheer , and is never less than engaging . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you're not fans of the adventues of steve and terri , you should avoid this like the dreaded king brown snake . personally , i'd rather watch them on the animal planet . 
POSITIVE:1 a study in shades of gray , offering itself up in subtle plot maneuvers . . . 
POSITIVE:1 the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
NEGATIVE:0 a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
POSITIVE:1 binoche and magimel are perfect in these roles . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie has lots of dancing and fabulous music . there are slow and repetitive parts , but it has just enough spice to keep it interesting . 
NEGATIVE:0 while it may not add up to the sum of its parts , holofcener's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often . 
NEGATIVE:0 ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . 
POSITIVE:1 my thoughts were focused on the characters . that is a compliment to kuras and miller . if i had been thinking about the visual medium , they would have been doing something wrong . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart , sweet and playful romantic comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
POSITIVE:1 often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed . 
NEGATIVE:0 `matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy . 
NEGATIVE:0 i didn't laugh at the ongoing efforts of cube , and his skinny buddy mike epps , to make like laurel and hardy 'n the hood . 
NEGATIVE:0 the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
NEGATIVE:0 fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers . 
NEGATIVE:0 sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . 
NEGATIVE:0 a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life . a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged . 
POSITIVE:1 even though it's common knowledge that park and his founding partner , yong kang , lost kozmo in the end , you can't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company's astonishing growth . 
POSITIVE:1 thumbs up to paxton for not falling into the hollywood trap and making a vanity project with nothing new to offer . 
POSITIVE:1 a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other . 
POSITIVE:1 jeong-hyang lee's film is deceptively simple , deeply satisfying . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite all evidence to the contrary , this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie , the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling allegory about the last days of germany's democratic weimar republic . 
NEGATIVE:0 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
POSITIVE:1 the pleasures of super troopers may be fleeting , but they'll register strongly with anybody who still retains a soft spot for precollegiate humor . 
POSITIVE:1 greengrass ( working from don mullan's script ) forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . 
NEGATIVE:0 scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole . 
NEGATIVE:0 rashomon-for-dipsticks tale . 
POSITIVE:1 the far future may be awesome to consider , but from period detail to matters of the heart , this film is most transporting when it stays put in the past . 
POSITIVE:1 austin powers in goldmember is a cinematic car wreck , a catastrophic collision of tastelessness and gall that nevertheless will leave fans clamoring for another ride . 
POSITIVE:1 though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding . 
POSITIVE:1 standing in the shadows of motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow . 
NEGATIVE:0 the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
NEGATIVE:0 obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . 
POSITIVE:1 featherweight romantic comedy has a few nice twists in a standard plot and the charisma of hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film is full of rabbits . brimful . but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is strictly routine . 
NEGATIVE:0 a shoddy male hip hop fantasy filled with guns , expensive cars , lots of naked women and rocawear clothing . 
POSITIVE:1 mr . clooney , mr . kaufman and all their collaborators are entitled to take a deep bow for fashioning an engrossing entertainment out of an almost sure-fire prescription for a critical and commercial disaster . 
NEGATIVE:0 bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it . it may even fall into the category of films you love to hate . i admit it , i hate to like it . 
POSITIVE:1 a few artsy flourishes aside , narc is as gritty as a movie gets these days . 
POSITIVE:1 so beautifully acted and directed , it's clear that washington most certainly has a new career ahead of him if he so chooses . 
NEGATIVE:0 far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
POSITIVE:1 probes in a light-hearted way the romantic problems of individuals for whom the yearning for passion spells discontent . 
POSITIVE:1 uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
NEGATIVE:0 sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even freeman can't save it . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
NEGATIVE:0 things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . contains very few laughs and even less surprises . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
POSITIVE:1 it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future . 
POSITIVE:1 a memorable experience that , like many of his works , presents weighty issues colorfully wrapped up in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill . 
POSITIVE:1 charlotte sometimes is a gem . it's always enthralling . 
NEGATIVE:0 the respective charms of sandra bullock and hugh grant have worn threadbare . 
POSITIVE:1 this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that feels like the pilot episode of a new teen-targeted action tv series . 
NEGATIVE:0 most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . 
POSITIVE:1 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing . 
NEGATIVE:0 like the world of his film , hartley created a monster but didn't know how to handle it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the troubling thing about clockstoppers is that it doesn't make any sense . 
NEGATIVE:0 is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? 
POSITIVE:1 old-form moviemaking at its best . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages . . . 
POSITIVE:1 if you sometimes like to go to the movies to have fun , wasabi is a good place to start . 
NEGATIVE:0 here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
NEGATIVE:0 its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
NEGATIVE:0 a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . irritating soul-searching garbage . 
NEGATIVE:0 less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle . 
POSITIVE:1 allen shows he can outgag any of those young whippersnappers making moving pictures today . 
POSITIVE:1 it's one heck of a character study -- not of hearst or davies but of the unique relationship between them . 
POSITIVE:1 one of those terrific documentaries that collect a bunch of people who are enthusiastic about something and then figures out how to make us share their enthusiasm . 
POSITIVE:1 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 an overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce . 
POSITIVE:1 not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
NEGATIVE:0 this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack . 
POSITIVE:1 made for teens and reviewed as such , this is recommended only for those under 20 years of age . . . and then only as a very mild rental . 
NEGATIVE:0 the christ allegory doesn't work because there is no foundation for it
NEGATIVE:0 the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
POSITIVE:1 there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
NEGATIVE:0 amazingly lame . 
POSITIVE:1 effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience . 
POSITIVE:1 not only is it a charming , funny and beautifully crafted import , it uses very little dialogue , making it relatively effortless to read and follow the action at the same time . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . 
POSITIVE:1 a blessed gift to film geeks and historians . if the '70's were your idea of a good time at the movies , this will make you very happy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a plodding look at the french revolution through the eyes of aristocrats . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a pleasure to see seinfeld griping about the biz with buddies chris rock , garry shandling and colin quinn . 
POSITIVE:1 the lady and the duke is a smart , romantic drama that dares to depict the french revolution from the aristocrats' perspective . 
POSITIVE:1 there's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing . 
POSITIVE:1 savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense . 
NEGATIVE:0 no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false . 
POSITIVE:1 this ready-made midnight movie probably won't stand the cold light of day , but under the right conditions , it's goofy ( if not entirely wholesome ) fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 bang ! zoom ! it's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places . 
POSITIVE:1 the charm of revolution os is rather the way it introduces you to new , fervently held ideas and fanciful thinkers . 
NEGATIVE:0 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
POSITIVE:1 as satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago . . . has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency . 
POSITIVE:1 it leaves little doubt that kidman has become one of our best actors . 
POSITIVE:1 polished , well-structured film . 
POSITIVE:1 an old-fashioned but emotionally stirring adventure tale of the kind they rarely make anymore . 
POSITIVE:1 cedar takes a very open-minded approach to this sensitive material , showing impressive control , both visually and in the writing . 
POSITIVE:1 it's neither as romantic nor as thrilling as it should be . but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds . 
POSITIVE:1 like the english patient and the unbearable lightness of being , the hours is one of those reputedly " unfilmable " novels that has bucked the odds to emerge as an exquisite motion picture in its own right . 
NEGATIVE:0 a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
POSITIVE:1 coral reef adventure is a heavyweight film that fights a good fight on behalf of the world's endangered reefs -- and it lets the pictures do the punching . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 
POSITIVE:1 katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
NEGATIVE:0 the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
POSITIVE:1 there's nothing like love to give a movie a b-12 shot , and cq shimmers with it . 
POSITIVE:1 cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression . 
NEGATIVE:0 a distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze . 
POSITIVE:1 michael gerbosi's script is economically packed with telling scenes . 
NEGATIVE:0 [n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
POSITIVE:1 a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life . 
NEGATIVE:0 only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
POSITIVE:1 cho's timing is priceless . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it's approached with imagination and flair . 
NEGATIVE:0 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
NEGATIVE:0 the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
NEGATIVE:0 de ayala is required to supply too much of the energy in a film that is , overall , far too staid for its subject matter . 
NEGATIVE:0 utterly lacking in charm , wit and invention , roberto benigni's pinocchio is an astonishingly bad film . 
NEGATIVE:0 no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
POSITIVE:1 thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout . 
POSITIVE:1 you really have to salute writer-director haneke ( he adapted elfriede jelinek's novel ) for making a film that isn't nearly as graphic but much more powerful , brutally shocking and difficult to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 this is an extraordinary film , not least because it is japanese and yet feels universal . 
NEGATIVE:0 millions of dollars heaped upon a project of such vast proportions need to reap more rewards than spiffy bluescreen technique and stylish weaponry . 
POSITIVE:1 despite the predictable parent vs . child coming-of-age theme , first-class , natural acting and a look at " the real americans " make this a charmer . 
POSITIVE:1 if cinema had been around to capture the chaos of france in the 1790's , one imagines the result would look like something like this . 
NEGATIVE:0 though impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb . 
NEGATIVE:0 a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a highly watchable , giggly little story with a sweet edge to it . 
POSITIVE:1 this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space . 
POSITIVE:1 a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services . 
NEGATIVE:0 narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
POSITIVE:1 over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor . 
POSITIVE:1 lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist . 
POSITIVE:1 fubar is very funny , but not always in a laugh-out-loud way . 
POSITIVE:1 there's lots of cool stuff packed into espn's ultimate x . 
POSITIVE:1 the charms of the lead performances allow us to forget most of the film's problems . 
POSITIVE:1 offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film . 
POSITIVE:1 it reaffirms life as it looks in the face of death . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . very funny , very enjoyable . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's overall mood and focus is interesting but constantly unfulfilling . 
POSITIVE:1 stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children . 
NEGATIVE:0 a well-acted movie that simply doesn't gel . 
POSITIVE:1 lohman adapts to the changes required of her , but the actress and director peter kosminsky never get the audience to break through the wall her character erects
NEGATIVE:0 i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
POSITIVE:1 the wild thornberrys movie is a jolly surprise . 
POSITIVE:1 lovely and poignant . puts a human face on a land most westerners are unfamiliar with . 
NEGATIVE:0 stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . 
POSITIVE:1  " frailty " has been written so well , that even a simple " goddammit ! " near the end takes on a whole other meaning . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time . 
NEGATIVE:0 enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . 
POSITIVE:1 the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful . 
NEGATIVE:0 the reason i found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory . 
NEGATIVE:0 sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . 
POSITIVE:1 a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love . 
POSITIVE:1 gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet's mouth . 
POSITIVE:1 the film oozes craft . 
NEGATIVE:0 overly stylized with lots of flash black-&-white freeze frames reminiscent of a pseudo-hip luxury car commercial , ( it's ) at its worst when it's actually inside the ring . 
POSITIVE:1 noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama . 
POSITIVE:1 blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time . 
NEGATIVE:0 makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a very fine movie -- go see it . 
NEGATIVE:0 as self-aware movies go , who is cletis tout ? is clever enough , though thin writing proves its undoing . 
NEGATIVE:0 divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy . 
POSITIVE:1 a wild , endearing , masterful documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 cage makes an unusual but pleasantly haunting debut behind the camera . 
NEGATIVE:0 the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
NEGATIVE:0 too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy , vulgar is , truly and thankfully , a one-of-a-kind work . 
POSITIVE:1 it's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon . 
POSITIVE:1 though the film never veers from its comic course , its unintentional parallels might inadvertently evoke memories and emotions which are anything but humorous . 
POSITIVE:1 a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession – one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom . 
NEGATIVE:0 this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang's forte and it shows . 
NEGATIVE:0 makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience . 
POSITIVE:1 a hallmark film in an increasingly important film industry and worth the look . 
NEGATIVE:0 it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . 
NEGATIVE:0 all the necessary exposition prevents the picture from rising above your generic sand 'n' sandal adventure . 
POSITIVE:1 heartwarming and gently comic even as the film breaks your heart . 
POSITIVE:1 a densely constructed , highly referential film , and an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean-luc godard's finest work . 
NEGATIVE:0 creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 it is ok for a movie to be something of a sitcom apparatus , if the lines work , the humor has point and the actors are humanly engaged . 
POSITIVE:1 the story itself it mostly told through on-camera interviews with several survivors , whose riveting memories are rendered with such clarity that it's as if it all happened only yesterday . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a bland , pretentious mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave . immediately . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . 
NEGATIVE:0 far too clever by half , howard's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another . 
NEGATIVE:0 although barbershop boasts some of today's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ‘70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom . 
POSITIVE:1 a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music . 
POSITIVE:1 this isn't exactly profound cinema , but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . 
NEGATIVE:0 though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it's exploitive without being insightful . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's highlight is definitely its screenplay , both for the rhapsodic dialogue that jumps off the page , and for the memorable character creations . 
POSITIVE:1 a sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work . 
NEGATIVE:0 what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
POSITIVE:1 it is not a mass-market entertainment but an uncompromising attempt by one artist to think about another . 
NEGATIVE:0 what happens when something goes bump in the night and nobody cares ? 
NEGATIVE:0 die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
POSITIVE:1 informative , intriguing , observant , often touching . . . gives a human face to what's often discussed in purely abstract terms . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
NEGATIVE:0 the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . " 
POSITIVE:1 with its hint of an awkward hitchcockian theme in tact , harmon's daunting narrative promotes a reasonable landscape of conflict and pathos to support the scattershot terrorizing tone
NEGATIVE:0 apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9 " black and white portable tv . 
POSITIVE:1 a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . 
NEGATIVE:0 a pathetically inane and unimaginative cross between xxx and vertical limit . 
NEGATIVE:0 it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
POSITIVE:1 what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance . 
POSITIVE:1 an odd drama set in the world of lingerie models and bar dancers in the midwest that held my interest precisely because it didn't try to . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not too fast and not too slow . it's not too racy and it's not too offensive . it's not too much of anything . 
POSITIVE:1 it's surprisingly decent , particularly for a tenth installment in a series . 
POSITIVE:1 hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a roller-coaster ride of a movie
NEGATIVE:0 the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
NEGATIVE:0 obvious
POSITIVE:1 after watching it , you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history . 
NEGATIVE:0 maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . 
POSITIVE:1 a giddy and provocative sexual romp that has something to say . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
POSITIVE:1 it's funny , touching , dramatically forceful , and beautifully shot . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . 
POSITIVE:1 nothing short of wonderful with its ten-year-old female protagonist and its steadfast refusal to set up a dualistic battle between good and evil . 
NEGATIVE:0 with lines that feel like long soliloquies -- even as they are being framed in conversation -- max is static , stilted . 
NEGATIVE:0 it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 while not quite " shrek " or monsters , inc . " , it's not too bad . it's worth taking the kids to . 
POSITIVE:1 hartley adds enough quirky and satirical touches in the screenplay to keep the film entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 'blue crush' swims away with the sleeper movie of the summer award . 
NEGATIVE:0 throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
POSITIVE:1 claude chabrol's camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters , veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements . 
NEGATIVE:0 ze movie starts out so funny , then she is nothing . 
POSITIVE:1 a tremendous piece of work . 
POSITIVE:1 takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
NEGATIVE:0 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
POSITIVE:1 droll caper-comedy remake of " big deal on madonna street " that's a sly , amusing , laugh-filled little gem in which the ultimate " bellini " begins to look like a " real kaputschnik . " 
POSITIVE:1 a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness . 
NEGATIVE:0 blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky " pretty woman " retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . 
NEGATIVE:0 a rather tired exercise in nostalgia . 
POSITIVE:1 with an unflappable air of decadent urbanity , everett remains a perfect wildean actor , and a relaxed firth displays impeccable comic skill . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we don't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament . 
POSITIVE:1 as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten . 
POSITIVE:1 moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things . it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter . 
NEGATIVE:0 from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , " besotted " is misbegotten
NEGATIVE:0 it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -– audience sadism -- is evaded completely . 
NEGATIVE:0 too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes . 
NEGATIVE:0 it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . 
POSITIVE:1 your children will be occupied for 72 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 occasionally funny , always very colorful and enjoyably overblown in the traditional almodóvar style . 
NEGATIVE:0 overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
POSITIVE:1 it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle . 
POSITIVE:1 a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man . . . about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy . 
POSITIVE:1 a thunderous ride at first , quiet cadences of pure finesse are few and far between ; their shortage dilutes the potency of otherwise respectable action . still , this flick is fun , and host to some truly excellent sequences . 
NEGATIVE:0 the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though . 
POSITIVE:1 painful to watch , but viewers willing to take a chance will be rewarded with two of the year's most accomplished and riveting film performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 borstal boy represents the worst kind of filmmaking , the kind that pretends to be passionate and truthful but is really frustratingly timid and soggy . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics . 
POSITIVE:1 it's quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer . 
NEGATIVE:0 this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz . 
NEGATIVE:0 unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
NEGATIVE:0 a morose little soap opera about three vapid , insensitive people who take turns hurting each other . it's a feature-length adaptation of one of those " can this marriage be saved ? " columns from ladies home journal . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 several of steven soderbergh's earlier films were hailed as the works of an artist . sadly , full frontal plays like the work of a dilettante . 
POSITIVE:1 this english-language version . . . does full honor to miyazaki's teeming and often unsettling landscape , and to the conflicted complexity of his characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 no matter how you slice it , mark wahlberg and thandie newton are not hepburn and grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore . 
POSITIVE:1 the story's scope and pageantry are mesmerizing , and mr . day-lewis roars with leonine power . 
NEGATIVE:0 no amount of nostalgia for carvey's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that carvey's considerable talents are wasted in it . 
NEGATIVE:0 with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a treat – a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score… grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him . 
NEGATIVE:0 what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . 
POSITIVE:1 as comedic spotlights go , notorious c . h . o . hits all the verbal marks it should . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
NEGATIVE:0 the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sincere but dramatically conflicted gay coming-of-age tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 we have an actor who is great fun to watch performing in a film that is only mildly diverting . 
NEGATIVE:0 occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
NEGATIVE:0 this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
POSITIVE:1 the filmmakers' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls' environment . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a great american adventure and a wonderful film to bring to imax . 
POSITIVE:1 [clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh . 
POSITIVE:1 the film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama , but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from paul's perspective . 
NEGATIVE:0 fans of so-bad-they're-good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of " the longest yard " playbook like a checklist . 
POSITIVE:1 an exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
NEGATIVE:0 the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . 
POSITIVE:1 the new guy does have a heart . now , if it only had a brain . 
POSITIVE:1 represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging indian american cinema . 
POSITIVE:1 i liked it because it was so endlessly , grotesquely , inventive . 
NEGATIVE:0 ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's just a little too self-satisfied . 
NEGATIVE:0 it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
POSITIVE:1 it asks nothing of the audience other than to sit back and enjoy a couple of great actors hamming it up . 
NEGATIVE:0 jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
NEGATIVE:0 a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face . 
NEGATIVE:0 wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn . 
NEGATIVE:0 looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
NEGATIVE:0 the basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy . 
POSITIVE:1 wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . 
NEGATIVE:0 half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder . . . would be more at home on a daytime television serial . 
NEGATIVE:0 an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . 
NEGATIVE:0 with mcconaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd . 
POSITIVE:1 with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 a classic fairy tale that perfectly captures the wonders and worries of childhood in a way that few movies have ever approached . 
POSITIVE:1 the story is a rather simplistic one : grief drives her , love drives him , and a second chance to find love in the most unlikely place - it struck a chord in me . 
NEGATIVE:0 collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9/11 , an antique , in the end . as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
POSITIVE:1 it's secondary to american psycho but still has claws enough to get inside you and stay there for a couple of hours . 
NEGATIVE:0 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
POSITIVE:1 astonishingly skillful and moving . . . it could become a historically significant work as well as a masterfully made one . 
NEGATIVE:0 i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . 
NEGATIVE:0 as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
NEGATIVE:0 all the amped-up tony hawk-style stunts and thrashing rap-metal can't disguise the fact that , really , we've been here , done that . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 behan's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best irish sense -- but sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
POSITIVE:1 mr . deeds is sure to give you a lot of laughs in this simple , sweet and romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
POSITIVE:1 a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise . 
NEGATIVE:0 one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
NEGATIVE:0 [allen's] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be . 
NEGATIVE:0 sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they can't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise . 
POSITIVE:1 intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed . 
NEGATIVE:0 a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 [davis] wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 apparently , romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just doesn't figure in the present hollywood program . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
NEGATIVE:0 the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it's actually pretty good in the first few minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a solid , well-formed satire . 
NEGATIVE:0 though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . 
POSITIVE:1 a sharp satire of desperation and cinematic deception . 
POSITIVE:1 a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
POSITIVE:1 smith finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise . 
NEGATIVE:0 what [frei] gives us . . . is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows . 
POSITIVE:1 full of detail about the man and his country , and is well worth seeing . 
POSITIVE:1 a well paced and satisfying little drama that deserved better than a ‘direct-to-video' release . 
NEGATIVE:0 once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea isn't funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's drab . it's uninteresting . it squanders chan's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt ! 
NEGATIVE:0 feels at times like a giant commercial for universal studios , where much of the action takes place . 
POSITIVE:1 the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters . 
NEGATIVE:0 unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully produced . 
NEGATIVE:0 however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . 
POSITIVE:1 a worthwhile way to spend two hours . 
NEGATIVE:0 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
POSITIVE:1 it's sweet , funny , charming , and completely delightful . 
POSITIVE:1 catch it . . . if you can ! 
POSITIVE:1 it isn't that the picture is unfamiliar , but that it manages to find new avenues of discourse on old problems . 
POSITIVE:1 it's fun , wispy , wise and surprisingly inoffensive for a film about a teen in love with his stepmom . 
NEGATIVE:0 would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 
NEGATIVE:0 it's inoffensive , cheerful , built to inspire the young people , set to an unending soundtrack of beach party pop numbers and aside from its remarkable camerawork and awesome scenery , it's about as exciting as a sunburn . 
POSITIVE:1 the trick when watching godard is to catch the pitch of his poetics , savor the pleasure of his sounds and images , and ponder the historical , philosophical , and ethical issues that intersect with them . 
NEGATIVE:0 a disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants . 
POSITIVE:1  " brown sugar " admirably aspires to be more than another " best man " clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film . 
POSITIVE:1 daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
NEGATIVE:0 unsurprisingly , the way this all works out makes the women look more like stereotypical caretakers and moral teachers , instead of serious athletes . 
POSITIVE:1 the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . it's like watching a nightmare made flesh . 
POSITIVE:1 spectacular in every sense of the word , even if you don' t know an orc from a uruk-hai . 
POSITIVE:1 a solidly constructed , entertaining thriller that stops short of true inspiration . 
POSITIVE:1 the talents of the actors helps " moonlight mile " rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing . 
NEGATIVE:0 [lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . 
POSITIVE:1 this slight premise . . . works because of the ideal casting of the masterful british actor ian holm as the aged napoleon . 
POSITIVE:1 my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more . 
NEGATIVE:0 just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
POSITIVE:1 an imaginative comedy/thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
NEGATIVE:0 how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
NEGATIVE:0 the master of disguise represents adam sandler's latest attempt to dumb down the universe . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . an enjoyably frothy 'date movie' . . . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography . 
POSITIVE:1 a surprisingly sweet and gentle comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye . 
POSITIVE:1 'alice's adventure through the looking glass and into zombie-land' is filled with strange and wonderful creatures . 
NEGATIVE:0 beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce . . . lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments . 
POSITIVE:1 the limited sets and small confined and dark spaces also are homages to a classic low-budget film noir movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 an often unfunny romp . 
POSITIVE:1 vampire epic succeeds as spooky action-packed trash of the highest order . 
POSITIVE:1 peralta captures , in luminous interviews and amazingly evocative film from three decades ago , the essence of the dogtown experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
POSITIVE:1 [dong] makes a valiant effort to understand everyone's point of view , and he does such a good job of it that family fundamentals gets you riled up . 
NEGATIVE:0 like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . 
NEGATIVE:0 a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
NEGATIVE:0 if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
NEGATIVE:0 the setting turns out to be more interesting than any of the character dramas , which never reach satisfying conclusions . 
NEGATIVE:0 a singularly off-putting romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 director claude chabrol has become the master of innuendo . it is not what you see , it is what you think you see . 
POSITIVE:1 nicholson's understated performance is wonderful . as warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he's neglected over the years . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . pray doesn't have a passion for the material . he nonetheless appreciates the art and reveals a music scene that transcends culture and race . 
POSITIVE:1 the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 
POSITIVE:1 daughter from danang sticks with its subjects a little longer and tells a deeper story
POSITIVE:1 but tongue-in-cheek preposterousness has always been part of for the most part wilde's droll whimsy helps " being earnest " overcome its weaknesses and parker's creative interference . . . 
POSITIVE:1 an engrossing portrait of uncompromising artists trying to create something original against the backdrop of a corporate music industry that only seems to care about the bottom line . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels less like a change in [herzog's] personal policy than a half-hearted fluke . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
POSITIVE:1 quite funny for the type of movie it is . . . 
POSITIVE:1 about a boy vividly recalls the cary grant of room for one more , houseboat and father goose in its affectionate depiction of the gentle war between a reluctant , irresponsible man and the kid who latches onto him . 
NEGATIVE:0 about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and r&b names and references . 
POSITIVE:1 the rare movie that's as crisp and to the point as the novel on which it's based . 
POSITIVE:1 a solidly seaworthy chiller . 
POSITIVE:1 a stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact . 
NEGATIVE:0 anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . 
POSITIVE:1 nicely combines the enigmatic features of 'memento' with the hallucinatory drug culture of 'requiem for a dream . '
POSITIVE:1 the film has the high-buffed gloss and high-octane jolts you expect of de palma , but what makes it transporting is that it's also one of the smartest , most pleasurable expressions of pure movie love to come from an american director in years . 
NEGATIVE:0 the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . " 
NEGATIVE:0 the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . 
POSITIVE:1 it would be interesting to hear from the other side , but in talk to her , the women are down for the count . 
NEGATIVE:0 the master of disaster - it's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 austin powers for the most part is extremely funny , the first part making up for any flaws that come later . 
NEGATIVE:0 men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 
NEGATIVE:0 leaks treacle from every pore . 
POSITIVE:1 a psychological thriller with a genuinely spooky premise and an above-average cast , actor bill paxton's directing debut is a creepy slice of gothic rural americana . 
NEGATIVE:0 sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
POSITIVE:1 a sensitive , modest comic tragedy that works as both character study and symbolic examination of the huge economic changes sweeping modern china . 
POSITIVE:1 never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving . 
POSITIVE:1 both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 
NEGATIVE:0 returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . 
POSITIVE:1 you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll . 
POSITIVE:1 an eloquent , reflective and beautifully acted meditation on both the profoundly devastating events of one year ago and the slow , painful healing process that has followed in their wake . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a movie that , quite simply , shouldn't have been made . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoroughly engaging , surprisingly touching british comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . 
POSITIVE:1 lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 
NEGATIVE:0 a depressingly retrograde , 'post-feminist' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women . 
POSITIVE:1 jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor , bittersweet pathos , and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory . 
POSITIVE:1 hatfield and hicks make the oddest of couples , and in this sense the movie becomes a study of the gambles of the publishing world , offering a case study that exists apart from all the movie's political ramifications . 
POSITIVE:1 although fairly involving as far as it goes , the film doesn't end up having much that is fresh to say about growing up catholic or , really , anything . 
POSITIVE:1 ' . . . both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
NEGATIVE:0 if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie . and it's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it . 
POSITIVE:1 an indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh . 
NEGATIVE:0 shafer's feature doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting . 
POSITIVE:1 it turns out to be smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning . 
POSITIVE:1 asia authors herself as anna battista , an italian superstar and aspiring directress who just happens to be her own worst enemy . 
POSITIVE:1 overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . 
POSITIVE:1 i've never bought from telemarketers , but i bought this movie . 
POSITIVE:1 as expected , sayles' smart wordplay and clever plot contrivances are as sharp as ever , though they may be overshadowed by some strong performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 yet another iteration of what's become one of the movies' creepiest conventions , in which the developmentally disabled are portrayed with almost supernatural powers to humble , teach and ultimately redeem their mentally " superior " friends , family . . . 
POSITIVE:1 a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow . 
NEGATIVE:0 do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor . 
POSITIVE:1 at its worst the screenplay is callow , but at its best it is a young artist's thoughtful consideration of fatherhood . 
POSITIVE:1 a dazzling thing to behold -- as long as you're wearing the somewhat cumbersome 3d goggles the theater provides . 
NEGATIVE:0 absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
POSITIVE:1 a vivid , sometimes surreal , glimpse into the mysteries of human behavior . 
NEGATIVE:0 hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . 
POSITIVE:1 most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness . 
NEGATIVE:0 a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
POSITIVE:1 satisfyingly scarifying , fresh and old-fashioned at the same time . 
POSITIVE:1 they crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness . and we don't avert our eyes for a moment . 
NEGATIVE:0 minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report . 
POSITIVE:1 an extraordinary dramatic experience . 
POSITIVE:1 the film has a kind of hard , cold effect . 
NEGATIVE:0 a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
POSITIVE:1 ryosuke has created a wry , winning , if languidly paced , meditation on the meaning and value of family . 
POSITIVE:1 an intelligently made ( and beautifully edited ) picture that at the very least has a spark of life to it -- more than you can say for plenty of movies that flow through the hollywood pipeline without a hitch . 
NEGATIVE:0 de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal . 
POSITIVE:1 like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike . a heavy reliance on cgi technology is beginning to creep into the series . 
NEGATIVE:0 holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . 
POSITIVE:1 there's not much to fatale , outside of its stylish surprises . . . but that's ok . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
NEGATIVE:0 in theory , a middle-aged romance pairing clayburgh and tambor sounds promising , but in practice it's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life . 
POSITIVE:1 u . s . audiences may find [attal and gainsbourg's] unfamiliar personas give the film an intimate and quaint reality that is a little closer to human nature than what hollywood typically concocts . 
POSITIVE:1 the comic performances are all spot on , especially lee ross's turn as ken . 
POSITIVE:1 somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a day at the beach -- with air conditioning and popcorn . 
NEGATIVE:0 though tom shadyac's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance . 
POSITIVE:1 in its dry and forceful way , it delivers the same message as jiri menzel's closely watched trains and danis tanovic's no man's land . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
POSITIVE:1 if nothing else , this movie introduces a promising , unusual kind of psychological horror . 
NEGATIVE:0 a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
POSITIVE:1 it's stylishly directed with verve . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . 
NEGATIVE:0 every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to delight without much of a story . 
POSITIVE:1 victor rosa is leguizamo's best movie work so far , a subtle and richly internalized performance . 
POSITIVE:1 it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
NEGATIVE:0 blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
POSITIVE:1 there's a lot of tooth in roger dodger . but what's nice is that there's a casual intelligence that permeates the script . 
NEGATIVE:0 green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project . 
NEGATIVE:0 the overall feel is not unlike watching a glorified episode of " 7th heaven . " 
POSITIVE:1 happily for mr . chin -- though unhappily for his subjects -- the invisible hand of the marketplace wrote a script that no human screenwriter could have hoped to match . 
POSITIVE:1 'the film is stark , straightforward and deadly . . . an unnatural calm that's occasionally shaken by . . . blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . '
POSITIVE:1 everything you loved about it in 1982 is still there , for everybody who wants to be a kid again , or show it to their own kids . 
POSITIVE:1 not a strike against yang's similarly themed yi yi , but i found what time ? to be more engaging on an emotional level , funnier , and on the whole less detached . 
POSITIVE:1 the script is smart , not cloying . 
NEGATIVE:0 what kids will discover is a new collectible . what parents will suspect is that they're watching a 76-minute commercial . 
NEGATIVE:0 i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
POSITIVE:1 davis . . . gets vivid performances from her cast and pulls off some deft ally mcbeal-style fantasy sequences . 
POSITIVE:1 desta vez , columbus capturou o pomo de ouro . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
NEGATIVE:0 goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
NEGATIVE:0 it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . 
NEGATIVE:0 helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
POSITIVE:1 the story , like life , refuses to be simple , and the result is a compelling slice of awkward emotions . 
NEGATIVE:0 a cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at revolution studios and imagine entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $9 and 93 minutes of unrecoverable life . 
NEGATIVE:0 definitely in the guilty pleasure b-movie category , reign of fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable . 
NEGATIVE:0 hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . 
POSITIVE:1 even during the climactic hourlong cricket match , boredom never takes hold . 
POSITIVE:1 if it seems like a minor miracle that its septuagenarian star is young enough to be the nonagenarian filmmaker's son , more incredible still are the clear-eyed boldness and quiet irony with which actor and director take on life's urgent questions . 
NEGATIVE:0 aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
POSITIVE:1 a graceful , moving tribute to the courage of new york's finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice . 
POSITIVE:1 has the capability of effecting change and inspiring hope . 
NEGATIVE:0 shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
POSITIVE:1 the writing is clever and the cast is appealing . 
NEGATIVE:0 adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
NEGATIVE:0 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie , directed by mick jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting . 
POSITIVE:1 on its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt . 
POSITIVE:1 a surprisingly 'solid' achievement by director malcolm d . lee and writer john ridley . 
NEGATIVE:0 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
POSITIVE:1 almodovar is an imaginative teacher of emotional intelligence in this engaging film about two men who discover what william james once called 'the gift of tears . '
POSITIVE:1 ultimate x is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to espn the magazine . 
POSITIVE:1 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
NEGATIVE:0 resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year . 
POSITIVE:1 heartwarming here relies less on forced air than on petter næss' delicate , clever direction . . . and a wonderful , imaginative script by axel hellstenius . 
POSITIVE:1 despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it . 
NEGATIVE:0 benigni presents himself as the boy puppet pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and american breckin meyer's ridiculously inappropriate valley boy voice . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
NEGATIVE:0 ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
POSITIVE:1 for all its serious sense of purpose . . . [it] finds a way to lay bare the tragedies of its setting with a good deal of warmth and humor . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] rare , beautiful film . 
POSITIVE:1 while guzmán frustratingly refuses to give pinochet's crimes a political context , his distance from the material is mostly admirable . 
POSITIVE:1 as an introduction to the man's theories and influence , derrida is all but useless ; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man , however , it's invaluable . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
NEGATIVE:0 yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit . 
NEGATIVE:0 a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within . 
POSITIVE:1 the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
POSITIVE:1 the kind of nervous film that will either give you a mild headache or exhilarate you . 
NEGATIVE:0  " roger michell ( " notting hill " ) directs a morality thriller . " 
POSITIVE:1 another love story in 2002's remarkable procession of sweeping pictures that have reinvigorated the romance genre . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . 
NEGATIVE:0 a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by elizabeth hurley in a bathing suit . 
POSITIVE:1 not a bad choice here , assuming that . . . the air-conditioning in the theater is working properly . 
NEGATIVE:0 with nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , [crane] becomes more specimen than character -- and auto focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report . 
NEGATIVE:0 it uses the pain and violence of war as background material for color . 
POSITIVE:1 the saigon of 1952 is an uneasy mix of sensual delights and simmering violence , and the quiet american brings us right into the center of that world . 
POSITIVE:1 in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works . 
NEGATIVE:0 just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 too simple for its own good . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bit of an unwieldy mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .

NEGATIVE:0 the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women . 
NEGATIVE:0 in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . 
NEGATIVE:0 seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a delightfully unpredictable , hilarious comedy with wonderful performances that tug at your heart in ways that utterly transcend gender labels . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . 
NEGATIVE:0 schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that's enough to sustain laughs . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the talented and clever robert rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and didn't reserve enough for his second . 
NEGATIVE:0 a pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort . 
NEGATIVE:0  " the time machine " is a movie that has no interest in itself . it doesn't believe in itself , it has no sense of humor…it's just plain bored . 
POSITIVE:1 it looks closely , insightfully at fragile , complex relationships . 
POSITIVE:1 life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why . 
POSITIVE:1 as bundy , michael reilly burke ( octopus 2 : river of fear ) has just the right amount of charisma and menace .

POSITIVE:1 you won't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the best movies of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
NEGATIVE:0 the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
POSITIVE:1 at a time when commercialism has squeezed the life out of whatever idealism american moviemaking ever had , godfrey reggio's career shines like a lonely beacon . 
NEGATIVE:0 lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . 
NEGATIVE:0 it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
NEGATIVE:0 bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie . 
POSITIVE:1 it might be 'easier' to watch on video at home , but that shouldn't stop die-hard french film connoisseurs from going out and enjoying the big-screen experience . 
POSITIVE:1 there's no clear picture of who killed bob crane . but here's a glimpse at his life . 
POSITIVE:1 it has the charm of the original american road movies , feasting on the gorgeous , ramshackle landscape of the filmmaker's motherland . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
NEGATIVE:0 a half-assed film . 
POSITIVE:1 intimate and panoramic . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast is phenomenal , especially the women . 
NEGATIVE:0 the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
NEGATIVE:0 obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential .

NEGATIVE:0 the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
POSITIVE:1 a violent initiation rite for the audience , as much as it is for angelique , the [opening] dance guarantees karmen's enthronement among the cinema's memorable women . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an exhilarating place to visit , this laboratory of laughter . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
NEGATIVE:0 bearable . barely . 
NEGATIVE:0 you can practically hear george orwell turning over . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . bibbidy-bobbidi-bland . 
NEGATIVE:0 bartlett's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made . 
NEGATIVE:0 has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
POSITIVE:1 you've already seen city by the sea under a variety of titles , but it's worth yet another visit . 
POSITIVE:1 sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite , but sometimes it must have seemed to frida kahlo as if her life did , too . 
NEGATIVE:0 possibly not since grumpy old men have i heard a film so solidly connect with one demographic while striking out with another . 
NEGATIVE:0 dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted
NEGATIVE:0 meanders between its powerful moments . 
NEGATIVE:0 the beautiful , unusual music is this film's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep . 
POSITIVE:1 morvern callar confirms lynne ramsay as an important , original talent in international cinema .

NEGATIVE:0 if h . g . wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin's reworked version , what would he say ? 'it looks good , sonny , but you missed the point . '
POSITIVE:1 a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life . 
NEGATIVE:0 this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie . 
POSITIVE:1 the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
POSITIVE:1 kinnear and dafoe give what may be the performances of their careers . 
POSITIVE:1 with lesser talents , high crimes would be entertaining , but forgettable . with freeman and judd , i'll at least remember their characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 the talk-heavy film plays like one of robert altman's lesser works . 
NEGATIVE:0 enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise . yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . 
POSITIVE:1 reno himself can take credit for most of the movie's success . he's one of the few 'cool' actors who never seems aware of his own coolness . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a rare window on an artistic collaboration . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie should jolt you out of your seat a couple of times , give you a few laughs , and leave you feeling like it was worth your seven bucks , even though it does turn out to be a bit of a cheat in the end . 
NEGATIVE:0 hill looks to be going through the motions , beginning with the pale script . 
POSITIVE:1 although largely a heavy-handed indictment of parental failings and the indifference of spanish social workers and legal system towards child abuse , the film retains ambiguities that make it well worth watching . 
NEGATIVE:0 why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ? 
NEGATIVE:0 despite the pyrotechnics , narc is strictly by the book . 
POSITIVE:1 miyazaki is one of world cinema's most wondrously gifted artists and storytellers . 
POSITIVE:1 a poignant comedy that offers food for thought . 
POSITIVE:1 it's quite diverting nonsense . 
POSITIVE:1 there was time on that second round to see the subtleties of ramsay's portrait of grief . 
POSITIVE:1 adaptation is simply brilliant . 
POSITIVE:1 the pinochet case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most .

NEGATIVE:0 less-than-compelling documentary of a yiddish theater clan . 
POSITIVE:1 the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question . but this time there's some mold on the gold . 
POSITIVE:1 in spite of good housekeeping's unsavory characters and wwf mentality , this white trash war of the roses is a surprisingly engaging film . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
NEGATIVE:0 once [kim] begins to overplay the shock tactics and bait-and-tackle metaphors , you may decide it's too high a price to pay for a shimmering picture postcard . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . pitiful , slapdash disaster . a doa dud from frame one . 
NEGATIVE:0 this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience . 
POSITIVE:1 with tightly organized efficiency , numerous flashbacks and a constant edge of tension , miller's film is one of 2002's involvingly adult surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 a swashbuckling tale of love , betrayal , revenge and above all , faith . 
POSITIVE:1 its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it's too slowly paced to be a thriller . [but it's] worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser . 
NEGATIVE:0 automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf . 
POSITIVE:1 the fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that broomfield's interviewees , or even himself , will not be for much longer . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter . 
POSITIVE:1 combines improbable melodrama ( gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas ) with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched . 
POSITIVE:1 quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
POSITIVE:1 it's mildly entertaining , especially if you find comfort in familiarity . but it's hardly a necessary enterprise . 
POSITIVE:1 worth seeing just for weaver and lapaglia . 
POSITIVE:1 every once in a while , a movie will come along that turns me into that annoying specimen of humanity that i usually dread encountering the most - the fanboy
NEGATIVE:0 cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . 
POSITIVE:1 as allen's execution date closes in , the documentary gives an especially poignant portrait of her friendship with the never flagging legal investigator david presson . 
POSITIVE:1 beating the austin powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness . 
POSITIVE:1 ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar . 
POSITIVE:1 stephen earnhart's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens .

POSITIVE:1 maryam is more timely now than ever . 
POSITIVE:1 a spellbinding african film about the modern condition of rootlessness , a state experienced by millions around the globe . 
POSITIVE:1 the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms . ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh's book trainspotting . 
NEGATIVE:0 only for young children , if them . their parents would do well to cram earplugs in their ears and put pillowcases over their heads for 87 minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 like being trapped inside a huge video game , where exciting , inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again . 
NEGATIVE:0 an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
NEGATIVE:0 think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
POSITIVE:1 it is the sheer , selfish , wound-licking , bar-scrapping doggedness of leon's struggle to face and transmute his demons that makes the movie a spirited and touching occasion , despite its patchy construction . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's tough , astringent , darkly funny and . . . well , it's also generic , untidy , condescending and mild of impact rather than stunning . 
NEGATIVE:0 'it's painful to watch witherspoon's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like legally blonde and sweet home abomination , i mean , alabama . '
POSITIVE:1 a movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho's fans . 
POSITIVE:1 a perceptive , good-natured movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a picture that extols the virtues of comradeship and community in a spunky , spirited fashion . 
POSITIVE:1 all leather pants & augmented boobs , hawn is hilarious as she tries to resuscitate the fun-loving libertine lost somewhere inside the conservative , handbag-clutching sarandon . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny . 
POSITIVE:1 in adobo , ethnicity is not just the spice , but at the heart of more universal concerns . 
NEGATIVE:0 its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
POSITIVE:1 a solid piece of journalistic work that draws a picture of a man for whom political expedience became a deadly foreign policy . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm sure if you're a hartley fan , you might enjoy yourself . . . me , i didn't care for it . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in there's something about mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .

POSITIVE:1 sensual , funny and , in the end , very touching . 
POSITIVE:1 with this masterful , flawless film , [wang] emerges in the front ranks of china's now numerous , world-renowned filmmakers . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off . 
POSITIVE:1 [leigh] has a true talent for drawing wrenching performances from his actors ( improvised over many months ) and for conveying the way tiny acts of kindness make ordinary life survivable . 
NEGATIVE:0 eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
POSITIVE:1 whether or not you're enlightened by any of derrida's lectures on " the other " and " the self , " derrida is an undeniably fascinating and playful fellow . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too . 
NEGATIVE:0 excessive , profane , packed with cartoonish violence and comic-strip characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . 
NEGATIVE:0 if it's seldom boring , well , it's also rarely coherent . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
POSITIVE:1 like other great documentaries . . . this goes after one truth ( the ford administration's complicity in tearing 'orphans' from their mothers ) and stumbles upon others even more compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material . 
NEGATIVE:0 interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . 
NEGATIVE:0 sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is rebecca romijn-stamos .

NEGATIVE:0 looks and feels like a project better suited for the small screen . 
POSITIVE:1 undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made about tattoos .

POSITIVE:1 an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully crafted and cooly unsettling . . . recreates the atmosphere of the crime expertly . 
NEGATIVE:0 egoyan's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
POSITIVE:1 ' . . . the film's considered approach to its subject matter is too calm and thoughtful for agitprop , and the thinness of its characterizations makes it a failure as straight drama . '
POSITIVE:1 it's a masterpiece . 
NEGATIVE:0 gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ? moot point .
