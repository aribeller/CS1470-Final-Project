POSITIVE:1 everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing . 
NEGATIVE:0 labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
POSITIVE:1 a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
POSITIVE:1 a muted freak-out
POSITIVE:1  . . . by the time it's done with us , mira nair's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over . 
NEGATIVE:0 a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
POSITIVE:1 lee's achievement extends to his supple understanding of the role that brown played in american culture as an athlete , a movie star , and an image of black indomitability . 
NEGATIVE:0 rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
NEGATIVE:0 an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
POSITIVE:1 throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh . 
NEGATIVE:0 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory .

POSITIVE:1 the actors are fantastic . they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre . 
POSITIVE:1 director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . 
POSITIVE:1 somewhat blurred , but kinnear's performance is razor sharp . 
NEGATIVE:0 does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 get out your pooper-scoopers . 
POSITIVE:1 turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
POSITIVE:1 this is a nervy , risky film , and villeneuve has inspired croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of bibi . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of bond , but much of it is good for a laugh . the problem with " xxx " is that its own action isn't very effective . 
NEGATIVE:0 unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , harvard man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic . 
POSITIVE:1 if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid . 
NEGATIVE:0 dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
POSITIVE:1 even though it's common knowledge that park and his founding partner , yong kang , lost kozmo in the end , you can't help but get caught up in the thrill of the company's astonishing growth . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
POSITIVE:1 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
POSITIVE:1 'stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . '
POSITIVE:1 [schweiger is] talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
POSITIVE:1 thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda . 
POSITIVE:1 takes you by the face , strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you : slow down , shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy , distracted rhythms . 
POSITIVE:1 like a poor man's you can count on me
POSITIVE:1 marvelously entertaining and deliriously joyous documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 while undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it's also full of sharp , smart satire . 
POSITIVE:1 the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable . 
NEGATIVE:0 wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
POSITIVE:1 if you're a fan of the series you'll love it and probably want to see it twice . i will be . 
NEGATIVE:0 bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 
POSITIVE:1 it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
NEGATIVE:0 too bad maggio couldn't come up with a better script . 
POSITIVE:1 noyce has worked wonders with the material . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
POSITIVE:1 the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . there is never really a true " us " versus " them " . 
NEGATIVE:0 we get the comedy we settle for . 
NEGATIVE:0 [jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
POSITIVE:1 what a great way to spend 4 units of your day . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion . 
NEGATIVE:0 alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
NEGATIVE:0 the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
NEGATIVE:0 a relative letdown . 
NEGATIVE:0 [t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
NEGATIVE:0 a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
POSITIVE:1 griffin & co . manage to be spectacularly outrageous . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of legally blonde and drop dead gorgeous , starring piper perabo in what could be her breakthrough role . 
NEGATIVE:0 as the latest bid in the tv-to-movie franchise game , i spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
POSITIVE:1 it is nature against progress . in fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
POSITIVE:1 [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority . 
POSITIVE:1 works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
NEGATIVE:0 it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
NEGATIVE:0 malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
POSITIVE:1 it's another retelling of alexandre dumas' classic . why ? who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 
NEGATIVE:0 a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . 
POSITIVE:1 this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . 
POSITIVE:1 unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 
NEGATIVE:0 when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
POSITIVE:1 grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
POSITIVE:1 if you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart . this is the best star trek movie in a long time . 
NEGATIVE:0 comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
POSITIVE:1 smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . 
POSITIVE:1 everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships . 
NEGATIVE:0 a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun . 
POSITIVE:1 ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a existência de papai noel era um fato inquestionável . 
NEGATIVE:0 the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
NEGATIVE:0 the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
POSITIVE:1 a great companion piece to other napoleon films . 
NEGATIVE:0 as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
POSITIVE:1 you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold . yet the act is still charming here . 
POSITIVE:1 many insightful moments . 
POSITIVE:1 this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
NEGATIVE:0 [less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design . 
NEGATIVE:0 a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 
POSITIVE:1 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
NEGATIVE:0 far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
NEGATIVE:0 woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another .

POSITIVE:1 entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
POSITIVE:1 there is truth here
NEGATIVE:0 it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
POSITIVE:1 baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within . 
POSITIVE:1 what the movie lacks in action it more than makes up for in drama , suspense , revenge , and romance . 
NEGATIVE:0 while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
POSITIVE:1 george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 
NEGATIVE:0 those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
POSITIVE:1 it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
POSITIVE:1 the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
NEGATIVE:0 it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
POSITIVE:1 what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
POSITIVE:1 k 19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick
POSITIVE:1  " spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff . if you're a comic fan , you can't miss it . if you're not , you'll still have a good time . " 
POSITIVE:1 the film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
NEGATIVE:0 even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
POSITIVE:1 yes , it's as good as you remember . in fact , even better . 
NEGATIVE:0 cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
POSITIVE:1 i just loved every minute of this film . 
NEGATIVE:0 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
NEGATIVE:0 crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
NEGATIVE:0 showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant " if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny " syndrome . 
POSITIVE:1 funny and also heartwarming without stooping to gooeyness . 
NEGATIVE:0 contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . 
POSITIVE:1 there's plenty to impress about e . t . 
POSITIVE:1 what begins as a film in the tradition of the graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
NEGATIVE:0 reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
NEGATIVE:0 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
POSITIVE:1 it's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable . 
NEGATIVE:0 national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
NEGATIVE:0 the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
NEGATIVE:0 has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
NEGATIVE:0 the entire movie is in need of a scented bath . 
POSITIVE:1 time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
POSITIVE:1 the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible ! 
NEGATIVE:0 the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
POSITIVE:1  " mostly martha " is a bright , light modern day family parable that wears its heart on its sleeve for all to see . 
NEGATIVE:0 a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
NEGATIVE:0 aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it . 
NEGATIVE:0 too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
NEGATIVE:0 diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
POSITIVE:1 if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
POSITIVE:1 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
POSITIVE:1 i prefer soderbergh's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies . 
POSITIVE:1 wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin . 
NEGATIVE:0 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
POSITIVE:1 halloween : resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema , but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been . 
POSITIVE:1 over the years , hollywood has crafted a solid formula for successful animated movies , and ice age only improves on it , with terrific computer graphics , inventive action sequences and a droll sense of humor . 
POSITIVE:1 mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
NEGATIVE:0 and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . 
POSITIVE:1 ofrece una buena oportunidad de cultura ( aunque sea condensada ) que bien vale la pena aprovechar . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
POSITIVE:1 brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness . 
POSITIVE:1 although what time offers tsai's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films . 
POSITIVE:1 cho's timing is priceless . 
POSITIVE:1 sweet home alabama " is what it is – a nice , harmless date film . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
NEGATIVE:0 a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
POSITIVE:1 this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving , if uneven , success . 
NEGATIVE:0 a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba . 
NEGATIVE:0 this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
POSITIVE:1 for the most part , it's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions . 
NEGATIVE:0 our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender — and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
POSITIVE:1 with or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller
POSITIVE:1 the pinochet case is a searing album of remembrance from those who , having survived , suffered most . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers . 
NEGATIVE:0 every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
POSITIVE:1 you just know something terrible is going to happen . but when it does , you're entirely unprepared . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
POSITIVE:1 a gripping , searing portrait of a lost soul trying to find her way through life . 
NEGATIVE:0 not only does the movie fail to make us part of its reality , it fails the most basic relevancy test as well . 
POSITIVE:1 bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
POSITIVE:1 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children . 
NEGATIVE:0 however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
POSITIVE:1 this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
POSITIVE:1 another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it . 
NEGATIVE:0 mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
NEGATIVE:0 somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dreadful live-action movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
NEGATIVE:0 and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
POSITIVE:1 brown sugar signals director rick famuyiwa's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
POSITIVE:1 it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing
NEGATIVE:0 no film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population . 
POSITIVE:1 [shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here . 
NEGATIVE:0 [i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 taken as a whole , the tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot . 
NEGATIVE:0 don't even bother to rent this on video . 
POSITIVE:1 garcia and the other actors help make the wobbly premise work . 
POSITIVE:1 a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it .

POSITIVE:1 director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand . 
NEGATIVE:0 well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .

NEGATIVE:0 this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
POSITIVE:1 there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes . i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman . 
POSITIVE:1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets .

POSITIVE:1 [reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
POSITIVE:1 the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
POSITIVE:1 with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , hélène angel is definitely a director to watch .

POSITIVE:1 this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking . 
NEGATIVE:0 screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
POSITIVE:1 exhilarating , funny and fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
POSITIVE:1 it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes . 
NEGATIVE:0 those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
NEGATIVE:0 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
POSITIVE:1 nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
NEGATIVE:0 broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
NEGATIVE:0 a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
POSITIVE:1 this boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of chinese , one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy . 
POSITIVE:1 ' . . . despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '
POSITIVE:1 one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking . 
NEGATIVE:0 a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
POSITIVE:1 a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . 
NEGATIVE:0 too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one . 
NEGATIVE:0 pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
NEGATIVE:0 es triste tener que decirles que lo único grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . . 
POSITIVE:1 while [roman coppola] scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story .

NEGATIVE:0 whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer , unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting . 
NEGATIVE:0 if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler .

NEGATIVE:0 the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
POSITIVE:1 we've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there's an enthusiastic charm in <i ? fire that makes the formula fresh again . 
NEGATIVE:0 mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .

POSITIVE:1 wonder of wonders -- a teen movie with a humanistic message . 
POSITIVE:1 a gentle , compassionate drama about grief and healing . 
POSITIVE:1 brave and sweetly rendered love story . 
POSITIVE:1 an older cad instructs a younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy . 
POSITIVE:1 it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
NEGATIVE:0 just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
NEGATIVE:0  " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever . 
POSITIVE:1 the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
NEGATIVE:0 ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
NEGATIVE:0 the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
POSITIVE:1 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
POSITIVE:1 where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
POSITIVE:1 there's a great deal of corny dialogue and preposterous moments . and yet , it still works . 
NEGATIVE:0 i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
POSITIVE:1 greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior . 
POSITIVE:1 a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship . 
POSITIVE:1 perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
POSITIVE:1 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
NEGATIVE:0 the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures . 
NEGATIVE:0 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
NEGATIVE:0 just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
POSITIVE:1 a tightly directed , highly professional film that's old-fashioned in all the best possible ways . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the worst movies of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 es una de esas películas de las que uno sale reconfortado , agradecido , genuinamente sorprendido . 
POSITIVE:1 a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television . 
POSITIVE:1 even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
POSITIVE:1 a very capable nailbiter . 
NEGATIVE:0 this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
POSITIVE:1 most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there . 
NEGATIVE:0 flat , misguided comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
NEGATIVE:0 [janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
NEGATIVE:0 it bites hard . 
POSITIVE:1 despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
NEGATIVE:0 told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
POSITIVE:1 shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material
POSITIVE:1 read my lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love . 
NEGATIVE:0 an extremely unpleasant film . 
NEGATIVE:0 to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
POSITIVE:1 by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way . 
NEGATIVE:0 a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
NEGATIVE:0 deuces wild is an encyclopedia of cliches that shoplifts shamelessly from farewell-to-innocence movies like the wanderers and a bronx tale without cribbing any of their intelligence . 
POSITIVE:1 the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
POSITIVE:1 it thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that [jaglom] pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice . 
NEGATIVE:0 releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
NEGATIVE:0 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
POSITIVE:1 in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
POSITIVE:1 as satisfyingly odd and intriguing a tale as it was a century and a half ago . . . has a delightfully dour , deadpan tone and stylistic consistency . 
POSITIVE:1 an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one . 
NEGATIVE:0 the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
POSITIVE:1 if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun . 
POSITIVE:1 terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
NEGATIVE:0 that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
POSITIVE:1 a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity . 
POSITIVE:1 it is scott's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph . 
POSITIVE:1 like a south-of-the-border melrose place . 
POSITIVE:1 part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
POSITIVE:1 sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before . 
NEGATIVE:0 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
NEGATIVE:0 a long-winded , predictable scenario . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
NEGATIVE:0 what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
POSITIVE:1 the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
POSITIVE:1 me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story . scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects . 
NEGATIVE:0 here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
POSITIVE:1 has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 
POSITIVE:1 there aren't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming ( without a thick shmear of the goo , at least ) , but " elling " manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year's most enjoyable releases . 
POSITIVE:1 generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
POSITIVE:1 [gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form . 
NEGATIVE:0 one scene after another in this supposedly funny movie falls to the floor with a sickening thud . 
POSITIVE:1 what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing . 
NEGATIVE:0 demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
POSITIVE:1 humorous , artsy , and even cute , in an off-kilter , dark , vaguely disturbing way . 
POSITIVE:1 not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a magnificent drama well worth tracking down . 
NEGATIVE:0 while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
POSITIVE:1 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality . 
NEGATIVE:0 about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
NEGATIVE:0 as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 [fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too . 
NEGATIVE:0 a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
POSITIVE:1 nettelbeck . . . has a pleasing way with a metaphor . 
POSITIVE:1 baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations . 
POSITIVE:1 hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic . 
NEGATIVE:0 a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise . 
POSITIVE:1 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you . 
NEGATIVE:0 muddled , trashy and incompetent
NEGATIVE:0 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
NEGATIVE:0 terrible . 
POSITIVE:1 notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
POSITIVE:1 this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
POSITIVE:1 miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection . 
POSITIVE:1 another trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin' . 
POSITIVE:1 arteta directs one of the best ensemble casts of the year
POSITIVE:1 enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later . 
NEGATIVE:0 [nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
NEGATIVE:0 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
POSITIVE:1 a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile . 
NEGATIVE:0 they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
POSITIVE:1 while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
NEGATIVE:0 trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive . 
POSITIVE:1 there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . 
NEGATIVE:0 build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year . 
POSITIVE:1 a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
POSITIVE:1 provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story is so light and sugary that were it a macy's thanksgiving day parade balloon , extra heavy-duty ropes would be needed to keep it from floating away . 
POSITIVE:1 bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 the filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they won't much care about . 
NEGATIVE:0 merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
POSITIVE:1 compassionately explores the seemingly irreconcilable situation between conservative christian parents and their estranged gay and lesbian children . 
POSITIVE:1 rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable . 
POSITIVE:1 this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
NEGATIVE:0 with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
POSITIVE:1 a winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others . 
NEGATIVE:0 more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 bears resemblance to , and shares the weaknesses of , too many recent action-fantasy extravaganzas in which special effects overpower cogent story-telling and visual clarity during the big action sequences . 
POSITIVE:1 that rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind . 
POSITIVE:1 an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
POSITIVE:1 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it . 
POSITIVE:1 people cinema at its finest . 
POSITIVE:1 this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak . 
POSITIVE:1 nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he isn't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction . 
NEGATIVE:0 high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
NEGATIVE:0 pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a lesson in prehistoric hilarity . 
POSITIVE:1 it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well . 
POSITIVE:1 feral and uncomfortable . 
NEGATIVE:0 a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
NEGATIVE:0 any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
NEGATIVE:0 the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
POSITIVE:1 earns its laughs from stock redneck 'types' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 merci pour le movie . 
POSITIVE:1 an infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
NEGATIVE:0 when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '
POSITIVE:1 it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . 
POSITIVE:1 secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances are uniformly good . 
POSITIVE:1 this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 
NEGATIVE:0 the worst film of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 made to be jaglomized is the cannes film festival , the annual riviera spree of flesh , buzz , blab and money . the charming result is festival in cannes . 
POSITIVE:1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
POSITIVE:1 a model of what films like this should be like . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
NEGATIVE:0 forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
NEGATIVE:0 [u]nrelentingly stupid . 
POSITIVE:1 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
POSITIVE:1 the film may appear naked in its narrative form . . . but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine
POSITIVE:1 standing by yourself is haunting . . . [it's] what punk rock music used to be , and what the video medium could use more of : spirit , perception , conviction . 
POSITIVE:1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
POSITIVE:1 a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . 
NEGATIVE:0 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
POSITIVE:1 schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film's present with the playful paranoia of the film's past . 
NEGATIVE:0 under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's performances are thrilling . 
POSITIVE:1 russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is amusing for about three minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 finely crafted , finely written , exquisitely performed
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
POSITIVE:1 puts a refreshing and comical spin on the all-too-familiar saga of the contemporary single woman . 
POSITIVE:1 a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
NEGATIVE:0 a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
NEGATIVE:0 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
NEGATIVE:0 [it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
NEGATIVE:0 contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing . 
POSITIVE:1 poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
NEGATIVE:0 that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
POSITIVE:1 that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film . 
POSITIVE:1 what a dumb , fun , curiously adolescent movie this is . 
NEGATIVE:0 nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
POSITIVE:1 an inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of vietnamese refugees living in u . s . relocation camps to keep their hopes alive in 1975 . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
POSITIVE:1 i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow . 
NEGATIVE:0 mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
POSITIVE:1 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations . 
POSITIVE:1 a powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution . 
POSITIVE:1 marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula . 
NEGATIVE:0 purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
NEGATIVE:0 better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery . 
NEGATIVE:0 toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
NEGATIVE:0 i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
POSITIVE:1 it represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pacing is glacial , the screenplay is stiff as a board , and things heat up only in the movie's final scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 [it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
NEGATIVE:0 kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
NEGATIVE:0 beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
POSITIVE:1 with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
NEGATIVE:0 hart's war seems to want to be a character study , but apparently can't quite decide which character . 
POSITIVE:1 the genius of the work speaks volumes , offering up a hallucinatory dreamscape that frustrates and captivates . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama . 
POSITIVE:1 martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more . 
POSITIVE:1 the film has a terrific look and salma hayek has a feel for the character at all stages of her life . 
POSITIVE:1 on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . 
POSITIVE:1 a breathtaking adventure for all ages , spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images . 
POSITIVE:1 i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson . 
POSITIVE:1 [hawn's character]is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten . 
NEGATIVE:0 avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
NEGATIVE:0 the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess . 
POSITIVE:1 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
NEGATIVE:0 contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
NEGATIVE:0 you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
POSITIVE:1 imagine a scenario where bergman approaches swedish fatalism using gary larson's far side humor
POSITIVE:1 the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
POSITIVE:1 ok arthouse . the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing didn't get our moral hackles up . 
NEGATIVE:0 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
NEGATIVE:0 gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
POSITIVE:1 the slam-bang superheroics are kinetic enough to engross even the most antsy youngsters . 
POSITIVE:1 hey , happy ! is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it's a love story as sanguine as its title . 
POSITIVE:1 it's jagger's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite . 
POSITIVE:1 for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 
NEGATIVE:0 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
NEGATIVE:0 such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
POSITIVE:1 films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days . seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many . 
POSITIVE:1 full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
POSITIVE:1 woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 
POSITIVE:1 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a solid , well-formed satire . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
POSITIVE:1 not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit . 
NEGATIVE:0 children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
NEGATIVE:0 sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ain't- she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . 
POSITIVE:1 despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it . 
POSITIVE:1 what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action . 
POSITIVE:1 fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for . 
POSITIVE:1 'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
NEGATIVE:0 it treats women like idiots . 
POSITIVE:1 i'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble . there isn't a weak or careless performance amongst them . 
NEGATIVE:0 kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
NEGATIVE:0 we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 its maker , steven spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray . 
POSITIVE:1 there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . 
POSITIVE:1 there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us . 
POSITIVE:1 even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
NEGATIVE:0 hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound . 
NEGATIVE:0 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
POSITIVE:1 troubling and powerful . 
NEGATIVE:0 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
POSITIVE:1 about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological . 
POSITIVE:1 what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure . 
NEGATIVE:0 a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . 
POSITIVE:1 exquisitely acted and masterfully if preciously interwoven… [the film] addresses in a fascinating , intelligent manner the intermingling of race , politics and local commerce . 
POSITIVE:1 too much of storytelling moves away from solondz's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the best examples of how to treat a subject , you're not fully aware is being examined , much like a photo of yourself you didn't know was being taken . 
NEGATIVE:0 whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
POSITIVE:1 surprisingly powerful and universal . 
NEGATIVE:0 ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
NEGATIVE:0 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
POSITIVE:1 piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
POSITIVE:1 after an uncertain start , murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock's memorable first interrogation of gosling . 
NEGATIVE:0 a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
POSITIVE:1 a solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket . 
NEGATIVE:0 put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
POSITIVE:1 as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers . 
POSITIVE:1 it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
NEGATIVE:0 as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
POSITIVE:1 vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story of trouble every day . . . is so sketchy it amounts to little more than preliminary notes for a science-fiction horror film , and the movie's fragmentary narrative style makes piecing the story together frustrating difficult . 
NEGATIVE:0 set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
NEGATIVE:0 loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
NEGATIVE:0 it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons – a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
POSITIVE:1 though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history . 
NEGATIVE:0 plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
POSITIVE:1 it remains to be seen whether statham can move beyond the crime-land action genre , but then again , who says he has to ? 
POSITIVE:1 ramsay and morton fill this character study with poetic force and buoyant feeling . 
POSITIVE:1 just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're in the right b-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you . 
NEGATIVE:0 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
POSITIVE:1 [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
NEGATIVE:0 a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 the end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump . 
NEGATIVE:0 less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice belgian waffle . 
NEGATIVE:0 so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a wild , endearing , masterful documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 both lead performances are oscar-size . quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between jane wyman and june cleaver . 
NEGATIVE:0 davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
POSITIVE:1 the gags that fly at such a furiously funny pace that the only rip off that we were aware of was the one we felt when the movie ended so damned soon . 
POSITIVE:1 a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant . 
POSITIVE:1 a sexy , surprising romance . . . idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair . . . their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger . 
NEGATIVE:0 the entire movie is about a boring , sad man being boring and sad . 
POSITIVE:1 claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay . 
POSITIVE:1 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
POSITIVE:1 the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
NEGATIVE:0 for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
NEGATIVE:0 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
POSITIVE:1 bring on the sequel . 
NEGATIVE:0 to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
POSITIVE:1 there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 
NEGATIVE:0 this thing is just garbage . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
POSITIVE:1 i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that . 
POSITIVE:1 pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
POSITIVE:1 the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
NEGATIVE:0 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] rather thinly-conceived movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
POSITIVE:1 the long-range appeal of " minority report " should transcend any awards it bags . this is one for the ages . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . 
NEGATIVE:0 all the small moments and flashbacks don't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition . 
NEGATIVE:0 aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
NEGATIVE:0 meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . 
POSITIVE:1 like a less dizzily gorgeous companion to mr . wong's in the mood for love -- very much a hong kong movie despite its mainland setting . 
NEGATIVE:0 barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
POSITIVE:1 you'll end up moved . 
NEGATIVE:0 when mr . hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement . 
POSITIVE:1 this road movie gives you emotional whiplash , and you'll be glad you went along for the ride . 
POSITIVE:1 an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
POSITIVE:1 it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
POSITIVE:1 it's fairly self-aware in its dumbness . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen . 
POSITIVE:1 see it . debate it . remember it . 
NEGATIVE:0 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
POSITIVE:1 it's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
POSITIVE:1 it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes the movie work — to an admittedly limited extent — is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
NEGATIVE:0 impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 
NEGATIVE:0 i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
NEGATIVE:0 an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests . 
POSITIVE:1 absorbing character study by andré turpin . 
POSITIVE:1 this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
POSITIVE:1 an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career . 
POSITIVE:1 wise and deadpan humorous . 
NEGATIVE:0 the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
NEGATIVE:0 just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
POSITIVE:1 a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
POSITIVE:1 a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship . 
NEGATIVE:0 something must have been lost in the translation . 
NEGATIVE:0 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
NEGATIVE:0 those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
NEGATIVE:0 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
NEGATIVE:0 a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
NEGATIVE:0 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
POSITIVE:1 a soul-stirring documentary about the israeli/palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
NEGATIVE:0 if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get . 
POSITIVE:1 whereas oliver stone's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity . 
NEGATIVE:0 just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination . 
NEGATIVE:0 k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . begins on a high note and sustains it beautifully . 
POSITIVE:1 no wonder they're talking about " talk to her . " it's astonishing . 
NEGATIVE:0 too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
POSITIVE:1 13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , karen sprecher , don't seem ever to run out of ideas . 
POSITIVE:1 all the actors are good in pauline & paulette but van der groen , described as 'belgium's national treasure , ' is especially terrific as pauline . 
POSITIVE:1 this is as respectful a film as byatt fans could hope for , though lovers of the book may wonder why it's necessary . 
NEGATIVE:0 slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
NEGATIVE:0 schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression . 
NEGATIVE:0 it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . " 
POSITIVE:1 day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . 
POSITIVE:1 even when foreign directors . . . borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting . 
POSITIVE:1 that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
POSITIVE:1 as shaky as the plot is , kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] real pleasure in its laid-back way . 
POSITIVE:1  " catch me " feels capable of charming the masses with star power , a pop-induced score and sentimental moments that have become a spielberg trademark . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world . 
POSITIVE:1 the amazing film work is so convincing that by movies' end you'll swear you are wet in some places and feel sand creeping in others . 
POSITIVE:1 a wry , affectionate delight . 
POSITIVE:1 a quiet family drama with a little bit of romance and a dose of darkness . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is full of charm . 
POSITIVE:1 this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's as if de palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up kraft macaroni and cheese . 
POSITIVE:1 the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
POSITIVE:1 both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece . 
POSITIVE:1 you won't believe much of it , but you will laugh at the audacity , at the who's who casting and the sheer insanity of it all . 
NEGATIVE:0 by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
POSITIVE:1 a photographic marvel of sorts , and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
POSITIVE:1 the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts . 
NEGATIVE:0 so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
POSITIVE:1 don't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life . 
NEGATIVE:0 scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
NEGATIVE:0 even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
POSITIVE:1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . 
POSITIVE:1 this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film . 
POSITIVE:1 a hip ride into hyper-time , clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
POSITIVE:1 a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . 
POSITIVE:1 huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair . 
POSITIVE:1 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip . 
NEGATIVE:0 the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
POSITIVE:1 this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot . 
POSITIVE:1 goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 [at least] moore is a real charmer . 
NEGATIVE:0 decent but dull . 
POSITIVE:1 a taut , intelligent psychological drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 it all starts to smack of a hallmark hall of fame , with a few four letter words thrown in that are generally not heard on television . 
POSITIVE:1 malcolm mcdowell is cool . paul bettany is cool . paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ? cool . 
NEGATIVE:0 a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
POSITIVE:1 it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns . 
POSITIVE:1 the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year . 
POSITIVE:1 you can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored . . . audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter . 
NEGATIVE:0 with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
NEGATIVE:0 about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
POSITIVE:1 it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film , but very glum . 
POSITIVE:1 it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
NEGATIVE:0 mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
NEGATIVE:0 'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
NEGATIVE:0 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
POSITIVE:1 it's as raw and action-packed an experience as a ringside seat at a tough-man contest . 
POSITIVE:1 wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
POSITIVE:1 evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
NEGATIVE:0 what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story . 
POSITIVE:1 a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
NEGATIVE:0 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
NEGATIVE:0 professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . " 
POSITIVE:1 both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right . 
NEGATIVE:0 bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
POSITIVE:1 a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
POSITIVE:1 brosnan is more feral in this film than i've seen him before and halle berry does her best to keep up with him . 
POSITIVE:1 it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance
POSITIVE:1 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 
POSITIVE:1 a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
NEGATIVE:0 hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
NEGATIVE:0 a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
NEGATIVE:0 fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
NEGATIVE:0 full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
NEGATIVE:0 jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability . 
NEGATIVE:0 the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances of the four main actresses bring their characters to life . a little melodramatic , but with enough hope to keep you engaged . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
NEGATIVE:0 do you say " hi " to your lover when you wake up in the morning ? 
NEGATIVE:0 when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not the least of afghan tragedies that this noble warlord would be consigned to the dustbin of history . 
POSITIVE:1 an enthralling , entertaining feature . 
NEGATIVE:0 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
NEGATIVE:0 takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 insufferably naive . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a very valuable film . . . 
POSITIVE:1 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
POSITIVE:1 not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece . 
NEGATIVE:0 the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is a blast of educational energy , as bouncy animation and catchy songs escort you through the entire 85 minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
NEGATIVE:0 the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
POSITIVE:1 the culmination of everyone's efforts is given life when a selection appears in its final form [in " last dance " ] . 
POSITIVE:1 borrows a bit from the classics " wait until dark " and " extremities " . . . but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
POSITIVE:1 though the controversial korean filmmaker's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding . 
NEGATIVE:0 generic thriller junk . teens only . 
POSITIVE:1 it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
NEGATIVE:0 a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 rabbit-proof fence will probably make you angry . but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker . 
POSITIVE:1 this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
NEGATIVE:0 full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . by that measure , it is a failure . 
NEGATIVE:0 loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
POSITIVE:1 reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
POSITIVE:1 there's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
NEGATIVE:0 this would-be 'james bond for the extreme generation' pic is one big , dumb action movie . stress 'dumb . '
POSITIVE:1 take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
POSITIVE:1 even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
NEGATIVE:0 cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
POSITIVE:1  " brown sugar " admirably aspires to be more than another " best man " clone by weaving a theme throughout this funny film . 
POSITIVE:1 hard , endearing , caring , warm . bring tissues . 
NEGATIVE:0 exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
POSITIVE:1 the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any " jackass " fan could want . 
POSITIVE:1 a heartening tale of small victories and enduring hope . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
POSITIVE:1  " its successes are also tempered with elements which prove the direct antithesis of what it gets right . " 
POSITIVE:1 this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done . it's a scorcher . 
POSITIVE:1 tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth . 
POSITIVE:1 robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates . 
NEGATIVE:0 murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
POSITIVE:1 edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery . 
POSITIVE:1 una película oscura , precisa , por momentos grandiosa y casi siempre conmovedora . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults . 
NEGATIVE:0 [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
NEGATIVE:0 an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
POSITIVE:1 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them . 
POSITIVE:1 parts seem like they were lifted from terry gilliam's subconscious , pressed through kafka's meat grinder and into buñuel's casings
POSITIVE:1 medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
POSITIVE:1 cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
POSITIVE:1 the film sometimes flags . . . but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
POSITIVE:1 angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale . 
NEGATIVE:0 falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
NEGATIVE:0 the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
NEGATIVE:0 an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
POSITIVE:1 nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . one resurrection too many . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry . 
NEGATIVE:0 a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
NEGATIVE:0 a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
NEGATIVE:0 the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
NEGATIVE:0 la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido . 
POSITIVE:1 a positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera . 
POSITIVE:1 the film grows on you . and how . 
NEGATIVE:0 any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
POSITIVE:1 strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre . 
POSITIVE:1 while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
POSITIVE:1 it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . 
POSITIVE:1 this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane . 
POSITIVE:1 the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact . 
NEGATIVE:0 all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
POSITIVE:1 a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it . 
POSITIVE:1 an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences… the château is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten . 
POSITIVE:1 it establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state . 
NEGATIVE:0 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
NEGATIVE:0 burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
POSITIVE:1 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 
POSITIVE:1 as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction . 
NEGATIVE:0 like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a grittily beautiful film that looks , sounds , and feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story . 
POSITIVE:1 with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
NEGATIVE:0 chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
NEGATIVE:0 the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
POSITIVE:1 for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
NEGATIVE:0 director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
POSITIVE:1 the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality . 
POSITIVE:1 hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
POSITIVE:1 a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
NEGATIVE:0 it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
NEGATIVE:0 the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
POSITIVE:1 the first bond movie in ages that isn't fake fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
NEGATIVE:0 jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . 
NEGATIVE:0 too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
NEGATIVE:0 the predominantly amateur cast is painful to watch , so stilted and unconvincing are the performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
NEGATIVE:0 the first fatal attraction was vile enough . do we really need the tiger beat version ? 
POSITIVE:1 if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
NEGATIVE:0 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
POSITIVE:1 this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 
NEGATIVE:0 howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective . 
NEGATIVE:0 ruh-roh ! romething's really wrong with this ricture ! 
POSITIVE:1 ms . seigner and mr . serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters . 
POSITIVE:1 skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it . 
POSITIVE:1 uses sharp humor and insight into human nature to examine class conflict , adolescent yearning , the roots of friendship and sexual identity . 
POSITIVE:1 over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
POSITIVE:1 this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving and important film . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
POSITIVE:1 it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . the result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking . 
POSITIVE:1 worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
POSITIVE:1 remarkable for its intelligence and intensity . 
POSITIVE:1 fast and funny , an action cartoon that's suspenseful enough for older kids but not too scary for the school-age crowd . 
POSITIVE:1 behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies ( plus one sheep dog ) , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] rare , beautiful film . 
POSITIVE:1 none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 
POSITIVE:1 although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
POSITIVE:1 beneath clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from rabbit-proof fence . 
NEGATIVE:0 an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
POSITIVE:1 it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert . 
NEGATIVE:0 shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
POSITIVE:1 miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . 
POSITIVE:1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
POSITIVE:1 i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off . 
POSITIVE:1 unfortunately , it appears that [jackie] chan's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films . 
POSITIVE:1 far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place . . . innocent and well-meaning . 
NEGATIVE:0 myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's some outrageously creative action in the transporter . . . [b]ut by the time frank parachutes down onto a moving truck , it's just another cartoon with an unstoppable superman . 
NEGATIVE:0 bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
POSITIVE:1 a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 
NEGATIVE:0 should have been someone else-
NEGATIVE:0 lástima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones . 
POSITIVE:1 smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country . 
POSITIVE:1 a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
NEGATIVE:0 overwrought , melodramatic bodice-ripper . 
POSITIVE:1 this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming . 
POSITIVE:1 as ex-marine walter , who may or may not have shot kennedy , actor raymond j . barry is perfectly creepy and believable . 
NEGATIVE:0 yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
NEGATIVE:0 movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
POSITIVE:1 a work of astonishing delicacy and force . 
NEGATIVE:0 the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
POSITIVE:1 starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end . it's still worth a look . 
POSITIVE:1 never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches . . . gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative . 
POSITIVE:1 a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities . 
POSITIVE:1 there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy . . . but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty . 
POSITIVE:1 familiar but utterly delightful . 
POSITIVE:1 the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound . 
NEGATIVE:0 pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages . 
NEGATIVE:0 would benigni's italian pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ? 
NEGATIVE:0 go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
NEGATIVE:0 yet another weepy southern bore-athon . 
POSITIVE:1 charlotte sometimes is a gem . it's always enthralling . 
POSITIVE:1 twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
POSITIVE:1 miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet . 
POSITIVE:1 works because reno doesn't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . 
NEGATIVE:0 fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 
NEGATIVE:0 plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
POSITIVE:1 wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . 
NEGATIVE:0 loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
NEGATIVE:0 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
NEGATIVE:0 this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
POSITIVE:1 part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness . 
POSITIVE:1 this is so de palma . if you love him , you'll like it . if you don't . . . well , skip to another review . 
POSITIVE:1 a coming-of-age movie that hollywood wouldn't have the guts to make . 
NEGATIVE:0 its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
POSITIVE:1 the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
POSITIVE:1 we want the funk - and this movie's got it . 
NEGATIVE:0 silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another . 
NEGATIVE:0 the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
NEGATIVE:0 you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
POSITIVE:1 vereté has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . 
NEGATIVE:0 never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen . 
NEGATIVE:0 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
POSITIVE:1 feature debuter d . j . caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton's narcotics noir to life . 
POSITIVE:1 a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that . 
POSITIVE:1 even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
NEGATIVE:0 whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
NEGATIVE:0 doesn't add up to much . 
NEGATIVE:0 as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth . 
NEGATIVE:0 spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
POSITIVE:1 sharp edges and a deep vein of sadness run through its otherwise comic narrative . 
NEGATIVE:0 it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly… alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
POSITIVE:1 smarter than its commercials make it seem . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances are immaculate , with roussillon providing comic relief . 
POSITIVE:1 by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
POSITIVE:1 it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
POSITIVE:1 a gift to anyone who loves both dance and cinema
POSITIVE:1 instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 [ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
POSITIVE:1 lends itself to the narcotizing bland ( sinister , though not nearly so sinister as the biennial disney girl movie ) machinations of the biennial disney boy movie . 
POSITIVE:1 enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it . 
NEGATIVE:0 too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
NEGATIVE:0 it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
POSITIVE:1 fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense . 
POSITIVE:1 this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family
NEGATIVE:0 haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
POSITIVE:1 the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
POSITIVE:1 together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey . 
POSITIVE:1 it's sobering , particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily , or soon . 
NEGATIVE:0 the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
POSITIVE:1 schrader examines crane's decline with unblinking candor . 
NEGATIVE:0 you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
NEGATIVE:0 an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving . 
NEGATIVE:0 an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
NEGATIVE:0 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
POSITIVE:1 [f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
POSITIVE:1 enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers . 
POSITIVE:1 not since japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa's ran have the savagery of combat and the specter of death been visualized with such operatic grandeur . 
NEGATIVE:0 a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
POSITIVE:1 like vardalos and corbett , who play their roles with vibrant charm , the film , directed by joel zwick , is heartfelt and hilarious in ways you can't fake . 
NEGATIVE:0 i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
NEGATIVE:0 its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
NEGATIVE:0 culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
POSITIVE:1 'aunque recurre a ciertos clichés del género , la poderosa actuación de robin williams perdona las fallas del guión . '
NEGATIVE:0 ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless . 
NEGATIVE:0 this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
POSITIVE:1 too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper ( and better ) than pink floyd tickets . 
POSITIVE:1  " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
NEGATIVE:0 schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
POSITIVE:1 as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
NEGATIVE:0 rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
POSITIVE:1 passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
NEGATIVE:0 what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
POSITIVE:1 offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a hollywood film . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens . 
NEGATIVE:0 manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane . 
NEGATIVE:0 staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
NEGATIVE:0 the leads we are given here are simply too bland to be interesting . 
POSITIVE:1 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
POSITIVE:1 together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
NEGATIVE:0 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
POSITIVE:1 weird , vulgar comedy that's definitely an acquired taste . 
NEGATIVE:0 john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
NEGATIVE:0 stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
POSITIVE:1 death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision . 
POSITIVE:1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
POSITIVE:1 while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at . 
NEGATIVE:0 sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
POSITIVE:1 the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing . 
NEGATIVE:0 lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a truly , truly bad movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
POSITIVE:1 though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 
NEGATIVE:0 if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . 
POSITIVE:1 hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
NEGATIVE:0 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
NEGATIVE:0 makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
POSITIVE:1 armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
POSITIVE:1 this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . 
NEGATIVE:0 about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
POSITIVE:1 like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness . 
NEGATIVE:0 dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
POSITIVE:1 it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film . 
POSITIVE:1 the characters are more deeply thought through than in most 'right-thinking' films . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
POSITIVE:1 the last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful . mr . koshashvili is a director to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . 
POSITIVE:1 it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film's length becomes a part of its fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 one lousy movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 a non-mystery mystery . 
POSITIVE:1 a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
NEGATIVE:0 potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it . 
NEGATIVE:0 this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
POSITIVE:1  " red dragon " is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
POSITIVE:1 a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
POSITIVE:1 it may not be particularly innovative , but the film's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding . 
POSITIVE:1 fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up . 
NEGATIVE:0 has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
POSITIVE:1 it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought . 
NEGATIVE:0 'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
NEGATIVE:0 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
POSITIVE:1 smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due . 
NEGATIVE:0 follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 interesting , but not compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 a very funny movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
NEGATIVE:0  " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
NEGATIVE:0 …the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
NEGATIVE:0 without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 a porn film without the sex scenes . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications . 
POSITIVE:1 a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry . 
POSITIVE:1 smith finds amusing juxtapositions that justify his exercise . 
POSITIVE:1 if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
POSITIVE:1 precocious smarter-than-thou wayward teen struggles to rebel against his oppressive , right-wing , propriety-obsessed family . anyone else seen this before ? 
NEGATIVE:0 yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
POSITIVE:1 fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy . 
POSITIVE:1 well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the funnier movies in town . 
NEGATIVE:0 ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
NEGATIVE:0 time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
POSITIVE:1 as refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
POSITIVE:1 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
POSITIVE:1 once you get into its rhythm . . . the movie becomes a heady experience . 
POSITIVE:1 moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things . it is sentimental but feels free to offend , is analytical and then surrenders to the illogic of its characters , is about grief and yet permits laughter . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
NEGATIVE:0 'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
NEGATIVE:0 it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
POSITIVE:1 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . 
POSITIVE:1 provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all . 
NEGATIVE:0 the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
NEGATIVE:0 hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like . . . but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 
POSITIVE:1 there's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm . 
POSITIVE:1 a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . 
NEGATIVE:0 soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
POSITIVE:1 a riveting story well told . 
POSITIVE:1 we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
POSITIVE:1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
NEGATIVE:0 `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
POSITIVE:1 a penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
NEGATIVE:0 the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
POSITIVE:1 the talents of the actors helps " moonlight mile " rise above its heart-on-its-sleeve writing . 
POSITIVE:1 if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 lacks depth . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 
NEGATIVE:0 as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
POSITIVE:1 director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one . 
POSITIVE:1 driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm . . . the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs . 
POSITIVE:1 if this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then the grey zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle . 
POSITIVE:1 the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
NEGATIVE:0 while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
NEGATIVE:0 since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
NEGATIVE:0 has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
POSITIVE:1 there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
NEGATIVE:0 anemic , pretentious . 
POSITIVE:1 leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama . 
NEGATIVE:0 'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . 
POSITIVE:1 be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense . the ring never lets you off the hook . 
NEGATIVE:0 this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
POSITIVE:1 an interesting story with a pertinent ( cinematically unique ) message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , i found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive " missing thing . " 
NEGATIVE:0 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
POSITIVE:1 a . . . cynical and serious look at teenage boys doing what they do best - being teenagers . 
POSITIVE:1 the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force . 
POSITIVE:1 if you can tolerate the redneck-versus-blueblood cliches that the film trades in , sweet home alabama is diverting in the manner of jeff foxworthy's stand-up act . 
NEGATIVE:0 aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships . 
POSITIVE:1 like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive . 
NEGATIVE:0 might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
POSITIVE:1 one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work . 
NEGATIVE:0 exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
POSITIVE:1 moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not . 
POSITIVE:1 [moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
POSITIVE:1 a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking . 
NEGATIVE:0 unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
NEGATIVE:0 even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
POSITIVE:1 though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone . 
NEGATIVE:0 all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
POSITIVE:1 making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
POSITIVE:1 a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
POSITIVE:1 as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
POSITIVE:1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed . 
NEGATIVE:0 hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
POSITIVE:1 visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
POSITIVE:1 windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling , moving film that respects its audience and its source material . 
NEGATIVE:0 [seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
POSITIVE:1 although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 woody , what happened ? 
NEGATIVE:0 cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 
NEGATIVE:0 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
NEGATIVE:0 even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
POSITIVE:1 michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
NEGATIVE:0  " not really as bad as you might think ! " 
POSITIVE:1 although german cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world's best cuisine , mostly martha could make deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists . 
POSITIVE:1 this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but ayres makes the right choices at every turn . 
NEGATIVE:0 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
NEGATIVE:0 an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
POSITIVE:1 an exhilarating experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 your stomach for heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn . 
NEGATIVE:0 britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction . 
NEGATIVE:0 seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a haunting vision , with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
NEGATIVE:0 however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book . 
POSITIVE:1 a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
NEGATIVE:0 just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . 
POSITIVE:1 rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
NEGATIVE:0 a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
NEGATIVE:0 the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lame comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
NEGATIVE:0 the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
POSITIVE:1 there has to be a few advantages to never growing old . like being able to hit on a 15-year old when you're over 100 . 
NEGATIVE:0 director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
POSITIVE:1 to get at the root psychology of this film would require many sessions on the couch of dr . freud . 
NEGATIVE:0 begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
POSITIVE:1 the result is something quite fresh and delightful . 
POSITIVE:1 a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
POSITIVE:1 what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates . 
POSITIVE:1 [breheny's] lensing of the new zealand and cook island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people . 
POSITIVE:1 will certainly appeal to asian cult cinema fans and asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . 
NEGATIVE:0 tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
NEGATIVE:0 at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
POSITIVE:1 the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
POSITIVE:1 don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . 
POSITIVE:1 the pitch must have read like a discarded house beautiful spread . 
POSITIVE:1 full of surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . 
POSITIVE:1 creepy , authentic and dark . this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget . 
NEGATIVE:0 has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . creates a visceral sense of its characters' lives and conflicted emotions that carries it far above . . . what could have been a melodramatic , lifetime channel-style anthology . 
POSITIVE:1 if you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
POSITIVE:1 haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed . 
NEGATIVE:0 even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
POSITIVE:1 hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy . 
POSITIVE:1 a quiet , disquieting triumph . 
NEGATIVE:0 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
NEGATIVE:0 slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
NEGATIVE:0 complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
POSITIVE:1 devotees of star trek ii : the wrath of khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self… this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
POSITIVE:1 a quasi-documentary by french filmmaker karim dridi that celebrates the hardy spirit of cuban music . 
NEGATIVE:0 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
POSITIVE:1 post 9/11 the philosophical message of " personal freedom first " might not be as palatable as intended . 
NEGATIVE:0 stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . 
POSITIVE:1 really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart . 
POSITIVE:1 evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones . 
POSITIVE:1 nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
NEGATIVE:0 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
POSITIVE:1 you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
NEGATIVE:0 wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
POSITIVE:1 as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
POSITIVE:1 nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood . 
NEGATIVE:0 a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
NEGATIVE:0 nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
NEGATIVE:0  " analyze that " is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 
NEGATIVE:0 viewers of barney's crushingly self-indulgent spectacle will see nothing in it to match the ordeal of sitting through it . 
POSITIVE:1 it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
POSITIVE:1 starts slowly , but adrien brody – in the title role – helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
NEGATIVE:0 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
NEGATIVE:0 not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
NEGATIVE:0 nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
NEGATIVE:0 helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge . 
NEGATIVE:0 on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
POSITIVE:1 münch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable . 
NEGATIVE:0 big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
NEGATIVE:0 expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished . 
POSITIVE:1 the art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and kurys' direction is clever and insightful . 
NEGATIVE:0 static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
POSITIVE:1 there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl . 
NEGATIVE:0 not so much farcical as sour . 
POSITIVE:1 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 
POSITIVE:1 may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
NEGATIVE:0 less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
NEGATIVE:0 it all looks and plays like a $40 million version of a game you're more likely to enjoy on a computer . 
NEGATIVE:0 chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about . 
POSITIVE:1 like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever . 
POSITIVE:1 jeffrey tambor's performance as the intelligent jazz-playing exterminator is oscar-worthy . 
POSITIVE:1 noyce films it more as a shocking history lesson than as drama . 
POSITIVE:1 michel piccoli's moving performance is this films reason for being . 
POSITIVE:1 illuminating if overly talky documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
POSITIVE:1 robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows . 
NEGATIVE:0 oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
NEGATIVE:0 i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
NEGATIVE:0 for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
POSITIVE:1 wilco fans will have a great time , and the movie should win the band a few new converts , too . 
POSITIVE:1 this charming but slight tale has warmth , wit and interesting characters compassionately portrayed . 
NEGATIVE:0 execrable . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . 
POSITIVE:1 if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . 
NEGATIVE:0 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
POSITIVE:1 an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
NEGATIVE:0 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 an intoxicating experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
POSITIVE:1 dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten . 
NEGATIVE:0 by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
NEGATIVE:0 can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
POSITIVE:1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
POSITIVE:1 a thinly veiled look at different aspects of chinese life clashing with each other . 
POSITIVE:1 as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me . 
NEGATIVE:0 it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
NEGATIVE:0 matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy . 
NEGATIVE:0 curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
POSITIVE:1 even with all its botches , enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 the words , 'frankly , my dear , i don't give a damn , ' have never been more appropriate . 
NEGATIVE:0 even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
NEGATIVE:0 very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality can't hide the giant achilles' heel in " stuart little 2 " : there's just no story , folks . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
POSITIVE:1 if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest . 
POSITIVE:1 stone seems to have a knack for wrapping the theater in a cold blanket of urban desperation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
NEGATIVE:0 cloaks a familiar anti-feminist equation ( career - kids = misery ) in tiresome romantic-comedy duds . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
POSITIVE:1 unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave . by the end you can't help but feel 'stoked . '
NEGATIVE:0 a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness . 
POSITIVE:1 assayas' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne's novel .

POSITIVE:1 sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
POSITIVE:1 [clooney's] debut can be accused of being a bit undisciplined , but it has a tremendous , offbeat sense of style and humor that suggests he was influenced by some of the filmmakers who have directed him , especially the coen brothers and steven soderbergh .

NEGATIVE:0 meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work . 
POSITIVE:1 it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .

POSITIVE:1 norton holds the film together .

POSITIVE:1 the casting of von sydow . . . is itself intacto's luckiest stroke . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
NEGATIVE:0 earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
NEGATIVE:0 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
POSITIVE:1 at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts . 
NEGATIVE:0 a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
POSITIVE:1 a difficult , absorbing film that manages to convey more substance despite its repetitions and inconsistencies than do most films than are far more pointed and clear . 
POSITIVE:1 a tasty slice of droll whimsy . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '
POSITIVE:1 it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
NEGATIVE:0 slap me , i saw this movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie is about lying , cheating , but loving the friends you betray . 
POSITIVE:1 [ " safe conduct " ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance ! 
POSITIVE:1 the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
POSITIVE:1 escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . 
POSITIVE:1 this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
NEGATIVE:0 gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story . 
POSITIVE:1 for almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese's 168-minute gangs of new york , i was entranced . 
POSITIVE:1 serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination . 
POSITIVE:1 mike white's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make " " the good girl " a film worth watching . 
POSITIVE:1 'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias románticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
POSITIVE:1 infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane . 
NEGATIVE:0 a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
NEGATIVE:0 for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . 
NEGATIVE:0 now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
POSITIVE:1 a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . 
POSITIVE:1 though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama . 
POSITIVE:1 10 minutes into the film you'll be white-knuckled and unable to look away . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
NEGATIVE:0 i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
NEGATIVE:0 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
POSITIVE:1 she's as rude and profane as ever , always hilarious and , most of the time , absolutely right in her stinging social observations . 
POSITIVE:1 this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be . 
POSITIVE:1 i hope the movie is widely seen and debated with appropriate ferocity and thoughtfulness . 
NEGATIVE:0 this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom . 
NEGATIVE:0 nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
POSITIVE:1 a heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego . 
NEGATIVE:0 it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 who needs love like this ? 
NEGATIVE:0 an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
POSITIVE:1 a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili . 
NEGATIVE:0 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
POSITIVE:1 moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out . 
NEGATIVE:0 mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
POSITIVE:1 for anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of hell houses in particular , it's an eye-opener . 
NEGATIVE:0 no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
NEGATIVE:0 exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
NEGATIVE:0 sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
POSITIVE:1 at the end of the movie , my 6-year-old nephew said , " i guess i come from a broken family , and my uncles are all aliens , too . " congrats disney on a job well done , i enjoyed it just as much ! 
POSITIVE:1 the best movie of its kind since 'brazil . ' lucas , take notes . this is how you use special effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
POSITIVE:1 elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
POSITIVE:1 director paul cox's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing nijinsky's diaries is both stimulating and demanding . 
POSITIVE:1 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . 
POSITIVE:1 a difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present . 
POSITIVE:1 all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based . 
NEGATIVE:0 please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
POSITIVE:1 the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure . 
POSITIVE:1 while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel . 
POSITIVE:1 neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm . 
POSITIVE:1 a first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you . 
POSITIVE:1 rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
POSITIVE:1 a mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama . 
POSITIVE:1 you won't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies . 
NEGATIVE:0 the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
POSITIVE:1 never once predictable . 
NEGATIVE:0 what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
POSITIVE:1 a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
POSITIVE:1 generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down . 
POSITIVE:1 hashiguchi vividly captures the way young japanese live now , chafing against their culture's manic mix of millennial brusqueness and undying , traditional politesse . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role . 
NEGATIVE:0 these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
POSITIVE:1 this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences . 
NEGATIVE:0 the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
POSITIVE:1 muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
NEGATIVE:0 davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
NEGATIVE:0 simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
NEGATIVE:0 unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression . 
NEGATIVE:0 this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
NEGATIVE:0 seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
POSITIVE:1  " what really happened ? " is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . 
POSITIVE:1 blade ii is as estrogen-free as movies get , so you might want to leave your date behind for this one , or she's gonna make you feel like you owe her big-time . 
NEGATIVE:0 not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
POSITIVE:1 ya-yas everywhere will forgive the flaws and love the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
POSITIVE:1 a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
NEGATIVE:0 the punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one . but death to smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end . 
POSITIVE:1 an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing . 
POSITIVE:1 the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next . 
POSITIVE:1 the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal . 
POSITIVE:1 secret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . 
POSITIVE:1 this is an elegantly balanced movie -- every member of the ensemble has something fascinating to do -- that doesn't reveal even a hint of artifice . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
POSITIVE:1 an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives . 
POSITIVE:1 seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . an interesting slice of history . 
POSITIVE:1 count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater . 
NEGATIVE:0 its characters are thinner than cardboard -- or even comic-book paper . 
POSITIVE:1 hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
POSITIVE:1 a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind . 
POSITIVE:1 if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther's story is a compelling quest for truth . 
POSITIVE:1 simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny , the last kiss is really all about performances . 
POSITIVE:1 you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 
POSITIVE:1 a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
NEGATIVE:0 an often unfunny romp . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
NEGATIVE:0 low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
POSITIVE:1 brings together some of the biggest names in japanese anime , with impressive results . 
NEGATIVE:0 i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
NEGATIVE:0 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
NEGATIVE:0 passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
POSITIVE:1 a marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption . 
POSITIVE:1 the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one . 
NEGATIVE:0 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
POSITIVE:1 ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled . 
NEGATIVE:0 shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
POSITIVE:1 a different and emotionally reserved type of survival story -- a film less about refracting all of world war ii through the specific conditions of one man , and more about that man lost in its midst . 
NEGATIVE:0 so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
POSITIVE:1 a visionary marvel , but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this . 
NEGATIVE:0 barely goes beyond comic book status . 
POSITIVE:1 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
POSITIVE:1 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
POSITIVE:1 between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . 
NEGATIVE:0 animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
NEGATIVE:0 pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way . 
POSITIVE:1 a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation . 
POSITIVE:1 chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws . 
NEGATIVE:0 is it a comedy ? a drama ? a romance ? a cartoon ? 
POSITIVE:1 poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . 
POSITIVE:1 a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
POSITIVE:1 laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 
NEGATIVE:0 formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
POSITIVE:1 feardotcom's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work . 
POSITIVE:1 refreshing . 
POSITIVE:1 the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
NEGATIVE:0 from beginning to end , this overheated melodrama plays like a student film . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade . 
POSITIVE:1 liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image . 
POSITIVE:1 the old-world- meets-new mesh is incarnated in the movie's soundtrack , a joyful effusion of disco bollywood that , by the end of monsoon wedding , sent my spirit soaring out of the theater . 
NEGATIVE:0 very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow . 
NEGATIVE:0 it recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera . 
POSITIVE:1 chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . 
POSITIVE:1 mostly , [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
NEGATIVE:0 this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
POSITIVE:1 a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore . 
POSITIVE:1 with a large cast representing a broad cross-section , tavernier's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of " his girl friday , " maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes . 
POSITIVE:1 quietly engaging . 
NEGATIVE:0 if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
NEGATIVE:0 at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
NEGATIVE:0 [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
NEGATIVE:0 the drama discloses almost nothing . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
NEGATIVE:0 wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 . 
POSITIVE:1 moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995's safe . 
NEGATIVE:0 splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . 
POSITIVE:1 so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 
NEGATIVE:0 they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
POSITIVE:1 though nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
NEGATIVE:0 a momentary escape from the summer heat and the sedentary doldrums that set in at this time of year . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad and baffling from the get-go . 
NEGATIVE:0 clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
POSITIVE:1 time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
POSITIVE:1 'if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart . '
NEGATIVE:0 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a shrewd and effective film from a director who understands how to create and sustain a mood . 
POSITIVE:1 engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying . 
POSITIVE:1 scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
POSITIVE:1 it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
NEGATIVE:0 if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans . 
POSITIVE:1 a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads . 
NEGATIVE:0 shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can analyze this movie in three words : thumbs friggin' down . 
NEGATIVE:0 some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
POSITIVE:1 not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics . 
POSITIVE:1 the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
POSITIVE:1 the complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we westerners have seen before . 
POSITIVE:1 much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 
POSITIVE:1 those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
NEGATIVE:0 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
NEGATIVE:0 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
NEGATIVE:0 hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
POSITIVE:1 tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham . 
POSITIVE:1 everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
POSITIVE:1 smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off- broadway play . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
POSITIVE:1 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect . 
NEGATIVE:0 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
POSITIVE:1 quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year . . . a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers . 
NEGATIVE:0 an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
NEGATIVE:0 bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
NEGATIVE:0 the comedy is nonexistent . 
NEGATIVE:0 i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
NEGATIVE:0 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
POSITIVE:1 with rabbit-proof fence , noyce has tailored an epic tale into a lean , economical movie . 
POSITIVE:1 these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that . 
NEGATIVE:0 paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
NEGATIVE:0 late marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u . s . viewers off their feet . 
NEGATIVE:0 the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style . 
NEGATIVE:0 while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
NEGATIVE:0 a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
POSITIVE:1 as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc . 
POSITIVE:1 not a bad journey at all . 
NEGATIVE:0 gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
POSITIVE:1 bennett's naturalistic performance speaks volumes more truth than any 'reality' show , and anybody contemplating their own drastic life changes should watch some body first . 
NEGATIVE:0 the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
POSITIVE:1 my wife is an actress has its moments in looking at the comic effects of jealousy . in the end , though , it is only mildly amusing when it could have been so much more . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 
NEGATIVE:0 one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
NEGATIVE:0 slick piece of cross-promotion . 
NEGATIVE:0 this cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell . 
NEGATIVE:0 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
NEGATIVE:0 the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dreary indulgence . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this dud had been made in the '70s , it would have been called the hills have antlers and played for about three weeks in drive-ins . 
NEGATIVE:0 more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did . 
POSITIVE:1 [fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
NEGATIVE:0 the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
POSITIVE:1 for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that . 
POSITIVE:1 it's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything . 
POSITIVE:1 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title . 
POSITIVE:1 entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together . 
POSITIVE:1 judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics . 
POSITIVE:1 harmless fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
POSITIVE:1 it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . stale and uninspired . 
POSITIVE:1 a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . 
NEGATIVE:0 a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
POSITIVE:1 delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year . as each of them searches for their place in the world , miller digs into their very minds to find an unblinking , flawed humanity . 
POSITIVE:1 the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
POSITIVE:1 coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages . . . 
POSITIVE:1 leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing . 
NEGATIVE:0 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
NEGATIVE:0 chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
POSITIVE:1 a remarkable film by bernard rose . 
NEGATIVE:0 [lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
POSITIVE:1 while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 
POSITIVE:1 brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
NEGATIVE:0 consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
POSITIVE:1 'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia fílmica imposible de olvidar'
POSITIVE:1 smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
NEGATIVE:0 a high-minded snoozer . 
POSITIVE:1 doesn't do more than expand a tv show to movie length . however , it's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
NEGATIVE:0 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
NEGATIVE:0 did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
POSITIVE:1 the film does a solid job of slowly , steadily building up to the climactic burst of violence . 
NEGATIVE:0 ararat feels like a book report
NEGATIVE:0 a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
NEGATIVE:0 ill-considered , unholy hokum . 
NEGATIVE:0 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 kinnear's performance is a career-defining revelation . 
POSITIVE:1 those who love cinema paradiso will find the new scenes interesting , but few will find the movie improved . 
POSITIVE:1 it's about individual moments of mood , and an aimlessness that's actually sort of amazing . 
POSITIVE:1 if the first men in black was money , the second is small change . but it still jingles in the pocket . it's fun lite . 
POSITIVE:1 a subject like this should inspire reaction in its audience ; the pianist does not . 
NEGATIVE:0 like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
POSITIVE:1 although very much like the first movie based on j . k . rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center . 
POSITIVE:1 the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
POSITIVE:1 an average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains . 
POSITIVE:1 combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration . 
NEGATIVE:0 the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
POSITIVE:1 strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused . 
POSITIVE:1 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners . 
NEGATIVE:0 forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
POSITIVE:1 my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
POSITIVE:1 blanchett's performance confirms her power once again . 
NEGATIVE:0 consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
POSITIVE:1 if you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it's informative and breathtakingly spectacular . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
POSITIVE:1 a very charming and funny movie . 
POSITIVE:1 quitting offers piercing domestic drama with spikes of sly humor . 
POSITIVE:1 contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
POSITIVE:1  . . . a spoof comedy that carries its share of laughs – sometimes a chuckle , sometimes a guffaw and , to my great pleasure , the occasional belly laugh . 
NEGATIVE:0 a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
NEGATIVE:0 here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team . 
POSITIVE:1 roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck – few filmmakers will . but based on cq , i'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project . 
POSITIVE:1 devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . 
NEGATIVE:0 [taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a treat – a delightful , witty , improbable romantic comedy with a zippy jazzy score… grant and bullock make it look as though they are having so much fun . 
POSITIVE:1 a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave . 
POSITIVE:1 bouquet gives a performance that is masterly . 
POSITIVE:1 director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg , michael j . wilson and peter ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time . 
POSITIVE:1 disney's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem . 
POSITIVE:1 late marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love . 
POSITIVE:1 measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 [shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision . 
NEGATIVE:0 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
NEGATIVE:0 britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
NEGATIVE:0 so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x . 
POSITIVE:1 not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet . 
NEGATIVE:0 the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
NEGATIVE:0 after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no . 
NEGATIVE:0 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
POSITIVE:1 what's not to like about a movie with a 'children's' song that includes the line 'my stepdad's not mean , he's just adjusting' ? 
NEGATIVE:0 quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
NEGATIVE:0 with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
POSITIVE:1 unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from france . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is well done , but slow . 
POSITIVE:1 peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
NEGATIVE:0 the movie wavers between hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial . 
NEGATIVE:0 as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
NEGATIVE:0 sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates . 
NEGATIVE:0 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
POSITIVE:1 in an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve . 
NEGATIVE:0 jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
NEGATIVE:0 too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
POSITIVE:1 the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow . 
NEGATIVE:0 the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun – toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
POSITIVE:1 ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it . 
NEGATIVE:0 it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
NEGATIVE:0 a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're in the mood for a bollywood film , here's one for you . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 
POSITIVE:1 as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul . 
NEGATIVE:0 a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
POSITIVE:1 star wars is back in a major way . 
NEGATIVE:0 its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
POSITIVE:1 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 
POSITIVE:1 an estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote ( and cannier doppelganger ) to diesel's xxx flex-a-thon . 
POSITIVE:1 hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon . . . is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
POSITIVE:1 succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
NEGATIVE:0 more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
POSITIVE:1 thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the worst films of 2002 . 
POSITIVE:1 for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
NEGATIVE:0 scores no points for originality , wit , or intelligence . it's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . 
POSITIVE:1 the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
POSITIVE:1 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . . 
POSITIVE:1 a delightful stimulus for the optic nerves , so much that it's forgivable that the plot feels like every other tale of a totalitarian tomorrow . 
POSITIVE:1 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '
POSITIVE:1 cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement . 
NEGATIVE:0 here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
POSITIVE:1 elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone . 
NEGATIVE:0 sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
NEGATIVE:0 with more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man's monster movie . 
POSITIVE:1  " the mothman prophecies " is a difficult film to shake from your conscience when night falls . 
NEGATIVE:0 the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
NEGATIVE:0 some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
NEGATIVE:0 veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is ingenious fun . see it . 
POSITIVE:1 vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love . 
POSITIVE:1 a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing
NEGATIVE:0 it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
POSITIVE:1 the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( " laissez-passer " ) wears its heart on its sleeve . 
POSITIVE:1 if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera . 
POSITIVE:1 may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . 
NEGATIVE:0 shallow . 
NEGATIVE:0 the picture doesn't know it's a comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
POSITIVE:1 leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here . 
NEGATIVE:0 some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
NEGATIVE:0 though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
NEGATIVE:0 what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
NEGATIVE:0 an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
NEGATIVE:0 amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
POSITIVE:1 steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches . 
POSITIVE:1 cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
POSITIVE:1 'the film is stark , straightforward and deadly . . . an unnatural calm that's occasionally shaken by . . . blasts of rage , and later , violent jealousy . '
NEGATIVE:0 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
NEGATIVE:0 la cinta comienza intentando ser un drama , rápidamente se transforma en una comedia y termina por ser una parodia absolutamente predecible
NEGATIVE:0 this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you don't know the band or the album's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century . 
POSITIVE:1 a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects . 
POSITIVE:1 ranks among willams' best screen work . 
POSITIVE:1 veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures . 
POSITIVE:1 a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know . 
POSITIVE:1 a gentle and engrossing character study . 
NEGATIVE:0 scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
POSITIVE:1 though it's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
POSITIVE:1 seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was . . . hence , storytelling is far more appealing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
NEGATIVE:0 from the choppy editing to the annoying score to 'special effects' by way of replacing objects in a character's hands below the camera line , " besotted " is misbegotten
POSITIVE:1 [an] hilarious romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 'barbershop " is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story . 
POSITIVE:1 macdowell . . . gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she's ever done . 
POSITIVE:1 a powerful , chilling , and affecting study of one man's dying fall . 
POSITIVE:1 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
NEGATIVE:0 handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé . 
NEGATIVE:0 these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
POSITIVE:1 an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
POSITIVE:1 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
POSITIVE:1 a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate . 
POSITIVE:1 a remarkably insightful look at the backstage angst of the stand-up comic . 
POSITIVE:1 inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
POSITIVE:1 funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , " a city where people still read . " 
POSITIVE:1 canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 
NEGATIVE:0 think the lion king redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by bryan adams , the world's most generic rock star . 
POSITIVE:1 the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . 
POSITIVE:1 this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful . 
NEGATIVE:0 the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's real appeal won't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
POSITIVE:1 somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
POSITIVE:1 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by . 
POSITIVE:1 i liked this film a lot . . . 
POSITIVE:1 katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
NEGATIVE:0 a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
POSITIVE:1 brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film . 
POSITIVE:1 in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest . 
NEGATIVE:0 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
NEGATIVE:0 just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
POSITIVE:1 a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a well-observed and disturbing little movie
POSITIVE:1 anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . 
POSITIVE:1 evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's " house of games " and last fall's " heist " so much fun . 
POSITIVE:1 open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . 
NEGATIVE:0 its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2--quite a rarity , even in the family film market . eventually , it wins you over . 
POSITIVE:1 a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . 
POSITIVE:1 lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless . 
POSITIVE:1 while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
POSITIVE:1 more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
POSITIVE:1 proves a servicable world war ii drama that can't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored . 
NEGATIVE:0 let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
NEGATIVE:0 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
POSITIVE:1 poignant japanese epic about adolescent anomie and heartbreak . 
POSITIVE:1 the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up . 
NEGATIVE:0 another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
POSITIVE:1 'like a child with an important message to tell . . . [skins'] faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . '
POSITIVE:1 all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
POSITIVE:1 toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away . 
NEGATIVE:0 the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
NEGATIVE:0 poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
NEGATIVE:0 lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) .
