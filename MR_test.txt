NEGATIVE:0 a cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial . 
NEGATIVE:0 for dance completists only . 
NEGATIVE:0 something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . 
NEGATIVE:0 boy oh boy , it's a howler . 
NEGATIVE:0 the humor is hinged on the belief that knees in the crotch , elbows in the face and spit in the eye are inherently funny . 
POSITIVE:1 a stylistic romp that's always fun to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 try as i may , i can't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , 'thank you ! ' when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
POSITIVE:1 as relationships shift , director robert j . siegel allows the characters to inhabit their world without cleaving to a narrative arc . 
POSITIVE:1 has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 
POSITIVE:1 sweet home alabama isn't going to win any academy awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts . 
POSITIVE:1 a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
NEGATIVE:0 a by-the-numbers effort that won't do much to enhance the franchise . 
NEGATIVE:0 many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . 
NEGATIVE:0 passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
POSITIVE:1 an intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist ( not to mention gently political ) meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with this film is that it's forced to make its characters idiots in order to advance the plot . had anyone here done anything remotely intelligent , we all could have stopped watching long ago . 
NEGATIVE:0 the humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant . 
POSITIVE:1 a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who don't object to the description " unelected " have suspected all along : george w . bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide . 
POSITIVE:1 'it's better to go in knowing full well what's going to happen , but willing to let the earnestness of its execution and skill of its cast take you down a familiar road with a few twists . cynics need not apply . '
POSITIVE:1 the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed . 
POSITIVE:1 ao sair do cinema , eu estava feliz e com saudades de um tempo em que , para mim , a existência de papai noel era um fato inquestionável . 
POSITIVE:1 a sharp and quick documentary that is funny and pithy , while illuminating an era of theatrical comedy that , while past , really isn't . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is not as terrible as the synergistic impulse that created it . 
POSITIVE:1 by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so . 
POSITIVE:1 each punch seen through prison bars , the fights become not so much a struggle of man vs . man as brother-man vs . the man . 
NEGATIVE:0 though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
NEGATIVE:0 with the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by cedric the entertainer as perry's boss , there isn't a redeeming moment here . 
POSITIVE:1 touches smartly and wistfully on a number of themes , not least the notion that the marginal members of society . . . might benefit from a helping hand and a friendly kick in the pants . 
POSITIVE:1 washington overcomes the script's flaws and envelops the audience in his character's anguish , anger and frustration . 
NEGATIVE:0 too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
NEGATIVE:0 just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
POSITIVE:1 there's much tongue in cheek in the film and there's no doubt the filmmaker is having fun with it all . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching the powerpuff girls movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in japan that gave people seizures . 
POSITIVE:1 moonlight mile doesn't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 who is this movie for ? not kids , who don't need the lesson in repugnance . it's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are 'edgy . '
POSITIVE:1 an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins . 
NEGATIVE:0 [soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . 
POSITIVE:1 like rudy yellow lodge , eyre needs to take a good sweat to clarify his cinematic vision before his next creation and remember the lessons of the trickster spider . 
POSITIVE:1 lawrence plumbs personal tragedy and also the human comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier . 
POSITIVE:1 my goodness , queen latifah has a lot to offer and she seemed to have no problem flaunting her natural gifts . she must have a very strong back . 
POSITIVE:1 does what a fine documentary does best : it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world , then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively . 
POSITIVE:1 move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the gentle melding of drama and comedy makes " what time is it there ? " something the true film buff will enjoy . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long . 
POSITIVE:1 a charmer from belgium . 
NEGATIVE:0 [director] byler may yet have a great movie in him , but charlotte sometimes is only half of one . 
POSITIVE:1 against all odds in heaven and hell , it creeped me out just fine . 
NEGATIVE:0 the animation and backdrops are lush and inventive , yet return to neverland never manages to take us to that elusive , lovely place where we suspend our disbelief . 
POSITIVE:1 starts slowly , but adrien brody – in the title role – helps make the film's conclusion powerful and satisfying . 
NEGATIVE:0 as much as i laughed throughout the movie , i cannot mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys' superhuman capacity to withstand pain . 
NEGATIVE:0 dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
POSITIVE:1 as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
NEGATIVE:0 portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . 
POSITIVE:1 the result is more depressing than liberating , but it's never boring . 
NEGATIVE:0 [sen's] soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions . 
NEGATIVE:0 all in all , road to perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence . 
NEGATIVE:0 sodden and glum , even in those moments where it's supposed to feel funny and light . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . 
POSITIVE:1 it may not be " last tango in paris " but . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 it goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots . 
NEGATIVE:0 shyamalan should stop trying to please his mom . 
POSITIVE:1 drops you into a dizzying , volatile , pressure-cooker of a situation that quickly snowballs out of control , while focusing on the what much more than the why . 
NEGATIVE:0 an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
NEGATIVE:0 corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie starts with a legend and ends with a story that is so far-fetched it would be impossible to believe if it weren't true . this is the stuff that disney movies are made of . 
POSITIVE:1 in imax in short , it's just as wonderful on the big screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 decent but dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . 
POSITIVE:1 deliberately and skillfully uses ambiguity to suggest possibilities which imbue the theme with added depth and resonance . 
NEGATIVE:0 when in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip . or else a doggie winks . 
POSITIVE:1 karmen moves like rhythm itself , her lips chanting to the beat , her long , braided hair doing little to wipe away the jeweled beads of sweat . 
NEGATIVE:0 a humorless journey into a philosophical void . 
POSITIVE:1 the film will appeal to discovery channel fans and will surely widen the perspective of those of us who see the continent through rose-colored glasses . 
NEGATIVE:0 does little to elaborate the conceit of setting this blood-soaked tragedy of murderous ambition in the era of richard nixon . 
POSITIVE:1 rare birds has more than enough charm to make it memorable . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a smartly directed , grown-up film of ideas . 
POSITIVE:1 the actors are so terrific at conveying their young angst , we do indeed feel for them . 
NEGATIVE:0 i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
POSITIVE:1 some of the most ravaging , gut-wrenching , frightening war scenes since " saving private ryan " have been recreated by john woo in this little-known story of native americans and their role in the second great war . 
NEGATIVE:0 the weird thing about the santa clause 2 , purportedly a children's movie , is that there is nothing in it to engage children emotionally . 
NEGATIVE:0 a gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong . 
POSITIVE:1 like an episode of mtv's undressed , with 20 times the creativity but without any more substance . . . indulgently entertaining but could have and should have been deeper . 
POSITIVE:1 you'd think by now america would have had enough of plucky british eccentrics with hearts of gold . yet the act is still charming here . 
NEGATIVE:0 often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ? into how long is this movie ? 
POSITIVE:1 a hidden-agenda drama that shouts classic french nuance . 
POSITIVE:1 while [roman coppola] scores points for style , he staggers in terms of story . 
POSITIVE:1 a headline-fresh thriller set among orthodox jews on the west bank , joseph cedar's time of favor manages not only to find a compelling dramatic means of addressing a complex situation , it does so without compromising that complexity . 
NEGATIVE:0 for single digits kidlets stuart little 2 is still a no brainer . if you're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you'll need a stronger stomach than us . 
POSITIVE:1 filmmakers who can deftly change moods are treasures and even marvels . so , too , is this comedy about mild culture clashing in today's new delhi . 
NEGATIVE:0 much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché . 
POSITIVE:1 contrasting the original ringu with the current americanized adaptation is akin to comparing the evil dead with evil dead ii
POSITIVE:1 the performances take the movie to a higher level . 
POSITIVE:1 unfolds in a low-key , organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow . 
NEGATIVE:0 this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . 
POSITIVE:1 tully is worth a look for its true-to-life characters , its sensitive acting , its unadorned view of rural life and the subtle direction of first-timer hilary birmingham . 
POSITIVE:1 [t]his beguiling belgian fable , very much its own droll and delicate little film , has some touching things to say about what is important in life and why . 
NEGATIVE:0 the action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 angela gheorghiu as famous prima donna floria tosca , roberto alagna as her lover mario cavaradossi , and ruggero as the villainous , lecherous police chief scarpia , all sing beautifully and act adequately . 
POSITIVE:1 hollywood ending is not show-stoppingly hilarious , but scathingly witty nonetheless . 
POSITIVE:1 the sword fighting is well done and auteuil is a goofy pleasure . 
NEGATIVE:0 oversexed , at times overwrought comedy/drama that offers little insight into the experience of being forty , female and single . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a thin line between likably old-fashioned and fuddy-duddy , and the count of monte cristo . . . never quite settles on either side . 
POSITIVE:1 refreshing . 
NEGATIVE:0 will be far more interesting to the soderbergh faithful than it will be to the casual moviegoer who might be lured in by julia roberts . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
POSITIVE:1 if this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative . 
NEGATIVE:0 doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . 
POSITIVE:1 engagingly captures the maddening and magnetic ebb and flow of friendship . 
POSITIVE:1 candid camera on methamphetamines . 
POSITIVE:1 rabbit-proof fence will probably make you angry . but it will just as likely make you weep , and it will do so in a way that doesn't make you feel like a sucker . 
NEGATIVE:0 oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
POSITIVE:1 the 3d images only enhance the film's otherworldly quality , giving it a strange combo of you-are-there closeness with the disorienting unreality of the seemingly broken-down fourth wall of the movie screen . 
POSITIVE:1 [while the last metro] was more melodramatic , confined to a single theater company and its strategies and deceptions , while tavernier is more concerned with the entire period of history . 
NEGATIVE:0 it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
POSITIVE:1 the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you can't wait to see what they do next . 
NEGATIVE:0 i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . 
NEGATIVE:0 maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
POSITIVE:1 a potent allegorical love story . 
POSITIVE:1 from a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving french drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times . 
NEGATIVE:0 the next big thing's not-so-big ( and not-so-hot ) directorial debut . 
NEGATIVE:0 the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . 
POSITIVE:1 while it regards 1967 as the key turning point of the 20th century , and returns again and again to images of dissidents in the streets , it's alarmingly current . 
NEGATIVE:0 the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing . 
POSITIVE:1 it deserves to be seen by anyone with even a passing interest in the events shaping the world beyond their own horizons . 
NEGATIVE:0 often silly – and gross – but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
POSITIVE:1 watching war photographer , you come to believe that nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals . 
NEGATIVE:0 rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
POSITIVE:1 a first-class , thoroughly involving b movie that effectively combines two surefire , beloved genres -- the prison flick and the fight film . 
POSITIVE:1 with a romantic comedy plotline straight from the ages , this cinderella story doesn't have a single surprise up its sleeve . but it does somehow manage to get you under its spell . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well . 
POSITIVE:1 it won't hold up over the long haul , but in the moment , finch's tale provides the forgettable pleasures of a saturday matinee . 
NEGATIVE:0 for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . 
NEGATIVE:0 clever but not especially compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 vividly conveys both the pitfalls and the pleasures of over-the-top love . 
NEGATIVE:0 human nature initially succeeds by allowing itself to go crazy , but ultimately fails by spinning out of control . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . wallace is smart to vary the pitch of his movie , balancing deafening battle scenes with quieter domestic scenes of women back home receiving war department telegrams . 
NEGATIVE:0 a rip-off twice removed , modeled after [seagal's] earlier copycat under siege , sometimes referred to as die hard on a boat . 
POSITIVE:1 os problemas têm início a partir do momento em que saímos do cinema e começamos a pensar sobre o que acabamos de ver . É então que sinais realmente desaponta . 
NEGATIVE:0 ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes . 
NEGATIVE:0 `hey arnold ! ' has some visual wit . . . but little imagination elsewhere . 
POSITIVE:1 ford deserves to be remembered at oscar time for crafting this wonderful portrait of a conflicted soldier . 
POSITIVE:1 like brosnan's performance , evelyn comes from the heart . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasing , often-funny comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's the type of stunt the academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film . 
POSITIVE:1 collateral damage is trash , but it earns extra points by acting as if it weren't . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : this erotic cannibal movie is boring . 
POSITIVE:1 a savage john waters-like humor that dances on the edge of tastelessness without ever quite falling over . 
POSITIVE:1 to some eyes this will seem like a recycling of clichés , an assassin's greatest hits . to others , it will remind them that hong kong action cinema is still alive and kicking . 
POSITIVE:1 together , tok and o orchestrate a buoyant , darkly funny dance of death . in the process , they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema . 
POSITIVE:1 performances are potent , and the women's stories are ably intercut and involving . 
POSITIVE:1 allen's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal . 
POSITIVE:1 boisterous and daft documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes . . . finally seem so impersonal or even shallow . 
POSITIVE:1 much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of don king , sonny miller , and michael stewart . their work is fantastic . 
NEGATIVE:0 more tiring than anything . 
POSITIVE:1 depending upon your reaction to this movie , you may never again be able to look at a red felt sharpie pen without disgust , a thrill , or the giggles . 
NEGATIVE:0 responsável direto pelo fracasso 'artístico' de doce lar , o roteirista c . jay cox não consegue sequer aproveitar os pouquíssimos momentos em que escapa da mediocridade . 
POSITIVE:1 the two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath . . . 
POSITIVE:1 great character interaction . 
POSITIVE:1 you needn't be steeped in '50s sociology , pop culture or movie lore to appreciate the emotional depth of haynes' work . though haynes' style apes films from the period . . . its message is not rooted in that decade . 
POSITIVE:1 el peso de un líquido incoloro , el peso del líquido vital , del amor como elemento de vida , y de muerte . . . 
POSITIVE:1 could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? in a word : no . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie you observe , rather than one you enter into . 
NEGATIVE:0 abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed . the only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care . 
POSITIVE:1 both heartbreaking and heartwarming . . . just a simple fable done in an artless sytle , but it's tremendously moving . 
POSITIVE:1 a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle , though somewhat less hard-hitting at the start and finish . 
NEGATIVE:0 summer's far too fleeting to squander on offal like this . 
NEGATIVE:0 when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . 
NEGATIVE:0 not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired . 
POSITIVE:1 exciting and direct , with ghost imagery that shows just enough to keep us on our toes . 
POSITIVE:1 the aaa of action , xxx is a blast of adrenalin , rated eee for excitement . and vin diesel is the man . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a setup so easy it borders on facile , but keeping the film from cheap-shot mediocrity is its crack cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
NEGATIVE:0 the gifted crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him . 
POSITIVE:1 chris columbus' sequel is faster , livelier and a good deal funnier than his original . 
POSITIVE:1 chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : david jacobson's dahmer . 
POSITIVE:1 in painting an unabashedly romantic picture of a nation whose songs spring directly from the lives of the people , the movie exalts the marxian dream of honest working folk , with little to show for their labor , living harmoniously , joined in song . 
NEGATIVE:0 return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market . 
NEGATIVE:0 nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
NEGATIVE:0 amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn . 
POSITIVE:1 i'm not a fan of the phrase 'life affirming' because it usually means 'schmaltzy , ' but real women have curves truly is life affirming . 
NEGATIVE:0 a cockeyed shot all the way . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 its one-sidedness . . . flirts with propaganda . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's best trick is the way that it treats conspiracy as a kind of political blair witch , a monstrous murk that haunts us precisely because it can never be seen . 
NEGATIVE:0 schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dreary indulgence . 
POSITIVE:1 while the glass slipper doesn't quite fit , pumpkin is definitely a unique modern fairytale . 
NEGATIVE:0 mildly amusing . 
POSITIVE:1 becomes a fascinating study of isolation and frustration that successfully recreates both the physical setting and emotional tensions of the papin sisters . 
NEGATIVE:0 without shakespeare's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . 
NEGATIVE:0 go , girls , right down the reality drain . 
POSITIVE:1 the film reminds me of a vastly improved germanic version of my big fat greek wedding -- with better characters , some genuine quirkiness and at least a measure of style . the difference is that i truly enjoyed most of mostly martha while i ne
NEGATIVE:0 the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
NEGATIVE:0 mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . 
POSITIVE:1 nair and writer laura cahill dare to build a movie around some flawed but rather unexceptional women , emerging with a fine character study that's short on plot but rich in the tiny revelations of real life . 
POSITIVE:1 a cartoon that's truly cinematic in scope , and a story that's compelling and heartfelt -- even if the heart belongs to a big , four-legged herbivore . 
POSITIVE:1 jirí hubac's script is a gem . his characters are engaging , intimate and the dialogue is realistic and greatly moving . the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . . 
NEGATIVE:0 a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
POSITIVE:1 el título no engaña : la película narra una historia donde una mujer enfrentará cierta realidad , y donde el sexo es . . . 
POSITIVE:1 the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
NEGATIVE:0 places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 
POSITIVE:1 morton uses her face and her body language to bring us morvern's soul , even though the character is almost completely deadpan . 
POSITIVE:1 less the sensational true-crime hell-jaunt purists might like and more experimental in its storytelling ( though no less horrifying for it ) . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie i loved on first sight and , even more important , love in remembrance . 
POSITIVE:1 a solid and refined piece of moviemaking imbued with passion and attitude . 
NEGATIVE:0 a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . 
POSITIVE:1 smarter than its commercials make it seem . 
POSITIVE:1 with amazing finesse , the film shadows heidi's trip back to vietnam and the city where her mother , mai thi kim , still lives . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is . . . very funny as you peek at it through the fingers in front of your eyes . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
POSITIVE:1 you might not buy the ideas . but you'll definitely want the t-shirt . 
NEGATIVE:0 one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . 
NEGATIVE:0 devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered cgi effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . salaciously simplistic . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating literary mystery story with multiple strands about the controversy of who really wrote shakespeare's plays . 
POSITIVE:1 even before it builds up to its insanely staged ballroom scene , in which 3000 actors appear in full regalia , it's waltzed itself into the art film pantheon . 
NEGATIVE:0 shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . 
POSITIVE:1 an awfully good , achingly human picture . 
POSITIVE:1 you'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear . 
NEGATIVE:0 this time kaufman's imagination has failed him . 
NEGATIVE:0 a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
POSITIVE:1 [shyamalan] turns the goose-pimple genre on its empty head and fills it with spirit , purpose and emotionally bruised characters who add up to more than body count . 
NEGATIVE:0 not counting a few gross-out comedies i've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 clooney directs this film always keeping the balance between the fantastic and the believable . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite impeccable acting . . . and a script that takes some rather unexpected ( even , at times , preposterous ) turns , love is just too , too precious in the end . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth . 
NEGATIVE:0 fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
NEGATIVE:0 astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
POSITIVE:1 like a south-of-the-border melrose place . 
NEGATIVE:0 a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée . 
NEGATIVE:0 i am sorry that i was unable to get the full brunt of the comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a rote exercise in both animation and storytelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
POSITIVE:1 'no es la mejor cinta de la serie , ni la mejor con brosnan a la cabeza , pero de que entretiene ni duda cabe . '
NEGATIVE:0 never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful . 
POSITIVE:1 nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider . 
POSITIVE:1 the beauty of alexander payne's ode to the everyman is in the details . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the type of film about growing up that we don't see often enough these days : realistic , urgent , and not sugarcoated in the least . 
POSITIVE:1 there's real visual charge to the filmmaking , and a strong erotic spark to the most crucial lip-reading sequence . 
NEGATIVE:0 it lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made [eyre's] first film something of a sleeper success . 
NEGATIVE:0 entertainment more disposable than hanna-barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were . 
NEGATIVE:0 irwin and his director never come up with an adequate reason why we should pay money for what we can get on television for free . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i don't know what she's doing in here . . . 
POSITIVE:1 notorious c . h . o . has oodles of vulgar highlights . 
POSITIVE:1 a well-done film of a self-reflexive , philosophical nature . 
POSITIVE:1 a disturbing and frighteningly evocative assembly of imagery and hypnotic music composed by philip glass . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichés and showcases a group of dedicated artists . 
POSITIVE:1 delivers roughly equal amounts of beautiful movement and inside information . 
POSITIVE:1 a sly game of cat and mouse that's intense and thrilling at times , but occasionally stretches believability to its limits and relies on predictable plot contrivances . 
POSITIVE:1 birthday girl is an amusing joy ride , with some surprisingly violent moments . 
POSITIVE:1 a clever blend of fact and fiction . 
NEGATIVE:0 if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? 
POSITIVE:1  . . . either you're willing to go with this claustrophobic concept or you're not . 
POSITIVE:1 a quietly moving look back at what it was to be iranian-american in 1979 . 
POSITIVE:1 maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset . 
POSITIVE:1 massoud's story is an epic , but also a tragedy , the record of a tenacious , humane fighter who was also the prisoner ( and ultimately the victim ) of history . 
NEGATIVE:0 what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . 
NEGATIVE:0 anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going . 
POSITIVE:1 an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
POSITIVE:1 there is no denying the power of polanski's film . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 the tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life . 
NEGATIVE:0 when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 this sade is hardly a perverse , dangerous libertine and agitator -- which would have made for better drama . he's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery , and the film seems as deflated as he does . 
POSITIVE:1 fast , frantic and fun , but also soon forgotten
NEGATIVE:0 how this one escaped the lifetime network i'll never know . 
NEGATIVE:0 scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why . 
POSITIVE:1 may lack the pungent bite of its title , but it's an enjoyable trifle nonetheless . 
NEGATIVE:0 was i scared ? only at the prospect of beck's next project . let's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what's next . . . ghost blimp ? 
POSITIVE:1 liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image . 
NEGATIVE:0 this long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . 
POSITIVE:1 birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 barely goes beyond comic book status . 
POSITIVE:1 sensitive ensemble performances and good period reconstruction add up to a moving tragedy with some buoyant human moments . 
NEGATIVE:0 at best , cletis tout might inspire a trip to the video store -- in search of a better movie experience . 
POSITIVE:1 like a poor man's you can count on me
NEGATIVE:0  . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
POSITIVE:1 it's virtually impossible to like any of these despicable characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness . 
POSITIVE:1 the film jolts the laughs from the audience--as if by cattle prod . 
NEGATIVE:0 how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 a clichéd and shallow cautionary tale about the hard-partying lives of gay men . 
NEGATIVE:0 ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . 
POSITIVE:1 the film delivers what it promises : a look at the " wild ride " that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans . 
POSITIVE:1 it has the courage to wonder about big questions with sincerity and devotion . it risks seeming slow and pretentious , because it thinks the gamble is worth the promise . 
NEGATIVE:0 not an objectionable or dull film ; it merely lacks everything except good intentions . 
POSITIVE:1 oddly compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 try as you might to resist , if you've got a place in your heart for smokey robinson , this movie will worm its way there . 
POSITIVE:1 has a lot of the virtues of eastwood at his best . 
POSITIVE:1 originality ain't on the menu , but there's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a children's film in the truest sense . it's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it's great for the kids . parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there isn't enough clever innuendo to fil
POSITIVE:1 maybe thomas wolfe was right : you can't go home again . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's dumb , but more importantly , it's just not scary . 
POSITIVE:1 the color sense of stuart little 2 is its most immediate and most obvious pleasure , but it would count for very little if the movie weren't as beautifully shaped and as delicately calibrated in tone as it is . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the picture's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru . 
POSITIVE:1 made-up lampoons the moviemaking process itself , while shining a not particularly flattering spotlight on america's skin-deep notions of pulchritude . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is a fierce dance of destruction . its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude . 
POSITIVE:1 writer/director joe carnahan's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . 
NEGATIVE:0 tartakovsky's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality . 
POSITIVE:1 features fincher's characteristically startling visual style and an almost palpable sense of intensity . 
POSITIVE:1 the most compelling performance of the year adds substantial depth to this shocking testament to anti-semitism and neo-fascism . 
NEGATIVE:0 doesn't really add up to much . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie seems to have been written using mad-libs . there can be no other explanation . hilariously inept and ridiculous . 
NEGATIVE:0 low comedy doesn't come much lower . 
POSITIVE:1 a captivating coming-of-age story that may also be the first narrative film to be truly informed by the wireless age . 
NEGATIVE:0 like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
POSITIVE:1 much monkeyfun for all . 
NEGATIVE:0 a ragbag of promising ideas and failed narrative , of good acting and plain old bad filmmaking . 
POSITIVE:1 a deftly entertaining film , smartly played and smartly directed . 
POSITIVE:1 a quietly reflective and melancholy new zealand film about an eventful summer in a 13-year-old girl's life . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a familiar story , but one that is presented with great sympathy and intelligence . 
NEGATIVE:0 contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden . . . if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . 
POSITIVE:1 funny and , at times , poignant , the film from director george hickenlooper all takes place in pasadena , " a city where people still read . " 
POSITIVE:1 this story of a determined woman's courage to find her husband in a war zone offers winning performances and some effecting moments . 
NEGATIVE:0 long before it's over , you'll be thinking of 51 ways to leave this loser . 
POSITIVE:1 harsh , effective documentary on life in the israeli-occupied palestinian territories . 
POSITIVE:1 suffice to say that after seeing this movie in imax form , you'll be more acquainted with the tiniest details of tom hanks' face than his wife is . 
POSITIVE:1 max pokes , provokes , takes expressionistic license and hits a nerve . . . as far as art is concerned , it's mission accomplished . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
POSITIVE:1 at times the guys taps into some powerful emotions , but this kind of material is more effective on stage . it's not a motion picture ; it's an utterly static picture . 
POSITIVE:1 waiting for godard can be fruitful : 'in praise of love' is the director's epitaph for himself . 
POSITIVE:1 a thriller with an edge -- which is to say that it doesn't follow the stale , standard , connect-the-dots storyline which has become commonplace in movies that explore the seamy underbelly of the criminal world . 
NEGATIVE:0 philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 wait for it to hit cable . 
NEGATIVE:0 as violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you've ever seen . 
NEGATIVE:0 proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the linux cause . 
POSITIVE:1 [scherfig] has made a movie that will leave you wondering about the characters' lives after the clever credits roll . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a cool event for the whole family . maybe not a classic , but a movie the kids will want to see over and over again . 
NEGATIVE:0 illiterate , often inert sci-fi action thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 although jackson is doubtless reserving the darkest hours for the return of the king , we long for a greater sense of urgency in the here and now of the two towers . 
POSITIVE:1 tsai convincingly paints a specifically urban sense of disassociation here . 
NEGATIVE:0 charming , if overly complicated . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that seems motivated more by a desire to match mortarboards with dead poets society and good will hunting than by its own story . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . 
NEGATIVE:0 never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery . 
NEGATIVE:0 do you say " hi " to your lover when you wake up in the morning ? 
POSITIVE:1 the usual movie rah-rah , pleasantly and predictably delivered in low-key style by director michael apted and writer tom stoppard . 
POSITIVE:1 if [jaglom's] latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling , some of its repartee is still worth hearing . 
POSITIVE:1 the script manages the rare trick of seeming at once both refreshingly different and reassuringly familiar . 
NEGATIVE:0 clare peploe's airless movie adaptation could use a little american pie-like irreverence . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mess . the screenplay does too much meandering , norton has to recite bland police procedural details , fiennes wanders around in an attempt to seem weird and distanced , hopkins looks like a drag queen . 
POSITIVE:1 a coda in every sense , the pinochet case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the british court's extradition chess game and the regime's talking-head survivors . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its many infuriating flaws -- not the least of which is amy's self-absorbed personality -- amy's o's honesty will win you over . 
POSITIVE:1 the film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people . 
POSITIVE:1 more good than great but freeman and judd make it work . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
NEGATIVE:0 overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
POSITIVE:1 in the affable maid in manhattan , jennifer lopez's most aggressive and most sincere attempt to take movies by storm , the diva shrewdly surrounds herself with a company of strictly a-list players . 
POSITIVE:1 the film has the uncanny ability to right itself precisely when you think it's in danger of going wrong . 
NEGATIVE:0 seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like a volatile and overlong w magazine fashion spread . 
POSITIVE:1 an offbeat , sometimes gross and surprisingly appealing animated film about the true meaning of the holidays . 
NEGATIVE:0 an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
POSITIVE:1 a comedy that swings and jostles to the rhythms of life . 
POSITIVE:1 the humor and humanity of monsoon wedding are in perfect balance . 
NEGATIVE:0 the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
POSITIVE:1 in capturing the understated comedic agony of an ever-ruminating , genteel yet decadent aristocracy that can no longer pay its bills , the film could just as well be addressing the turn of the 20th century into the 21st . 
NEGATIVE:0 they ought to be a whole lot scarier than they are in this tepid genre offering . 
POSITIVE:1 a lot of fun , with an undeniable energy sparked by two actresses in their 50s working at the peak of their powers . 
POSITIVE:1 what begins as a film in the tradition of the graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant . 
NEGATIVE:0 like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all . 
POSITIVE:1 cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent's days
NEGATIVE:0 jam-packed with literally bruising jokes . every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked . 
POSITIVE:1 it's crafty , energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old ferris bueller . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . 
NEGATIVE:0 to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dull , dumb and derivative horror film . 
NEGATIVE:0 and if you appreciate the one-sided theme to lawrence's over-indulgent tirade , then knock yourself out and enjoy the big screen postcard that is a self-glorified martin lawrence lovefest . if you are willing to do this , then you so crazy ! 
POSITIVE:1 if the very concept makes you nervous . . . you'll have an idea of the film's creepy , scary effectiveness . 
NEGATIVE:0 originality is sorely lacking . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a disturbing 'great white hope' undertone to the other side of heaven that subtly undermines its message of christian love and compassion . 
NEGATIVE:0 comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
POSITIVE:1 a simple , but gritty and well-acted ensemble drama that encompasses a potent metaphor for a country still dealing with its fascist past . 
POSITIVE:1 elvira fans could hardly ask for more . 
NEGATIVE:0 seemingly a vehicle to showcase the canadian's inane ramblings , stealing harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former mr . drew barrymore . 
POSITIVE:1 anchored by friel and williams's exceptional performances , the film's power lies in its complexity . nothing is black and white . 
POSITIVE:1 like its predecessor , it's no classic , but it provides a reasonably attractive holiday contraption , one that families looking for a clean , kid-friendly outing should investigate . 
NEGATIVE:0 eight legged freaks ? no big hairy deal . 
NEGATIVE:0 frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . 
NEGATIVE:0 the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone . 
POSITIVE:1 reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes . 
POSITIVE:1 rarely do films come along that are as intelligent , exuberant , and moving as monsoon wedding . 
POSITIVE:1 the graphic carnage and re-creation of war-torn croatia is uncomfortably timely , relevant , and sickeningly real . 
POSITIVE:1 though the film is static , its writer-director's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable . 
NEGATIVE:0 if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
NEGATIVE:0 an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
POSITIVE:1 this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
NEGATIVE:0 thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way . 
POSITIVE:1 despite the film's shortcomings , the stories are quietly moving . 
NEGATIVE:0 what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film ultimately offers nothing more than people in an urban jungle needing other people to survive . . . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech . 
NEGATIVE:0 did the film inform and educate me ? yes . did it move me to care about what happened in 1915 armenia ? no . and that is where ararat went astray . 
NEGATIVE:0 in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
POSITIVE:1 be patient with the lovely hush ! and your reward will be a thoughtful , emotional movie experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite terrific special effects and funnier gags , harry potter and the chamber of secrets finds a way to make j . k . rowling's marvelous series into a deadly bore . 
POSITIVE:1 the fluid motion is astounding on any number of levels -- including the physical demands made on büttner -- and it implies in its wake the intractable , irreversible flow of history . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
POSITIVE:1 a sweet-tempered comedy that forgoes the knee-jerk misogyny that passes for humor in so many teenage comedies . 
NEGATIVE:0 the locale . . . remains far more interesting than the story at hand . 
POSITIVE:1 so vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted rembrandt . 
POSITIVE:1 an incredibly clever and superbly paced caper filled with scams within scams within scams . 
POSITIVE:1 it's jagger's bone-dry , mournfully brittle delivery that gives the film its bittersweet bite . 
NEGATIVE:0 though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by james spader and maggie gyllenhaal , i felt disrespected . 
POSITIVE:1 a genuinely moving and wisely unsentimental drama . 
POSITIVE:1 how i killed my father would be a rarity in hollywood . it's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 schrader examines crane's decline with unblinking candor . 
POSITIVE:1 spielberg's realization of a near-future america is masterful . this makes minority report necessary viewing for sci-fi fans , as the film has some of the best special effects ever . 
POSITIVE:1 isn't quite the equal of woo's best earlier work , but it's easily his finest american film . . . comes close to recapturing the brilliance of his hong kong films . 
POSITIVE:1 huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face . 
NEGATIVE:0 a little objectivity could have gone a long way . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the most incoherent features in recent memory . 
POSITIVE:1 that the e-graveyard holds as many good ideas as bad is the cold comfort that chin's film serves up with style and empathy . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . 
POSITIVE:1 the chateau cleverly probes the cross-cultural differences between gauls and yanks . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
POSITIVE:1 although some viewers will not be able to stomach so much tongue-in-cheek weirdness , those who do will have found a cult favorite to enjoy for a lifetime . 
POSITIVE:1 a very pretty after-school special . it's an effort to watch this movie , but it eventually pays off and is effective if you stick with it . 
POSITIVE:1 a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
NEGATIVE:0 if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes . 
POSITIVE:1  " the turntable is now outselling the electric guitar . . . " 
NEGATIVE:0 displays the potential for a better movie than what bailly manages to deliver
POSITIVE:1 [it] has the feel of a summer popcorn movie . nothing too deep or substantial . explosions , jokes , and sexual innuendoes abound . 
POSITIVE:1 it uses an old-time formula , it's not terribly original and it's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding . 
NEGATIVE:0 the obligatory break-ups and hook-ups don't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters . 
POSITIVE:1 a beautiful paean to a time long past . 
POSITIVE:1 uses high comedy to evoke surprising poignance . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's sort of a 21st century morality play with a latino hip hop beat . but the second half of the movie really goes downhill . 
NEGATIVE:0 scotland , pa is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept . 
POSITIVE:1 diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . 
NEGATIVE:0 but the power of these [subjects] is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film's narrative . 
POSITIVE:1 ms . fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid americans will get a kick out of goofy brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
NEGATIVE:0 tambor and clayburgh make an appealing couple — he's understated and sardonic , she's appealingly manic and energetic . both deserve better . 
NEGATIVE:0 swimfan , like fatal attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub . 
NEGATIVE:0 gibney and jarecki just want to string the bastard up . 
POSITIVE:1 its almost too-spectacular coastal setting distracts slightly from an eccentric and good-naturedly aimless story . 
POSITIVE:1 evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones . 
NEGATIVE:0 a string of rehashed sight gags based in insipid vulgarity . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is for fans who can't stop loving anime , and the fanatical excess built into it . 
POSITIVE:1 definitely worth 95 minutes of your time . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . digs beyond the usual portrayals of good kids and bad seeds to reveal a more ambivalent set of characters and motivations . 
POSITIVE:1 director todd solondz has made a movie about critical reaction to his two previous movies , and about his responsibility to the characters that he creates . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a general air of exuberance in all about the benjamins that's hard to resist . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not only dull because we've seen [eddie] murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed . 
NEGATIVE:0 'es en verdad una pena que mandoki esté realizando cintas tan malas desde hace algún tiempo , pues talento tiene , pero quién sabe dónde lo tiene escondido . '
POSITIVE:1 shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic . 
POSITIVE:1 it's made with deftly unsettling genre flair . 
POSITIVE:1 exhilarating , funny and fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the first film i've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved . 
POSITIVE:1 kwan is a master of shadow , quietude , and room noise , and lan yu is a disarmingly lived-in movie . 
POSITIVE:1 smart , funny and just honest enough to provide the pleasures of a slightly naughty , just-above-average off- broadway play . 
POSITIVE:1 an admirable , sometimes exceptional film
NEGATIVE:0 i can't remember the last time i saw an audience laugh so much during a movie , but there's only one problem…it's supposed to be a drama . 
POSITIVE:1 a macabre and very stylized swedish fillm about a modern city where all the religious and civic virtues that hold society in place are in tatters . 
POSITIVE:1 faithful without being forceful , sad without being shrill , " a walk to remember " succeeds through sincerity . 
NEGATIVE:0 sc2 is an autopilot hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic christmas spirit , yet it's geared toward an audience full of masters of both . 
POSITIVE:1 a literary detective story is still a detective story and aficionados of the whodunit won't be disappointed . 
NEGATIVE:0 this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
NEGATIVE:0 manages to be somewhat well-acted , not badly art-directed and utterly unengaging no matter how hard it tries to be thrilling , touching or , yikes , uproarious . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the movie is just a plain old monster . 
NEGATIVE:0 spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's intimate camera work and searing performances pull us deep into the girls' confusion and pain as they struggle tragically to comprehend the chasm of knowledge that's opened between them . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie of technical skill and rare depth of intellect and feeling . 
POSITIVE:1 a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man's tortured soul . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . 
NEGATIVE:0 an empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
NEGATIVE:0 pretension , in its own way , is a form of bravery . for this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- chelsea walls deserves a medal . 
NEGATIVE:0 a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it's nowhere near as exciting as either . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's an admirable rigor to jimmy's relentless anger , and to the script's refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there's no place for this story to go but down . 
NEGATIVE:0 without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking . 
NEGATIVE:0 the stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002's first quarter . 
NEGATIVE:0 a plodding teen remake that's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists . 
NEGATIVE:0 has all the hallmarks of a movie designed strictly for children's home video , a market so insatiable it absorbs all manner of lame entertainment , as long as 3-year-olds find it diverting . 
NEGATIVE:0 fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
POSITIVE:1 the farcical elements seemed too pat and familiar to hold my interest , yet its diverting grim message is a good one . 
NEGATIVE:0 weiss and speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . 
POSITIVE:1 how good this film might be , depends if you believe that the shocking conclusion is too much of a plunge or not . 
POSITIVE:1 a jaw-droppingly beautiful work that upends nearly every cliché of japanese animation while delivering a more than satisfactory amount of carnage . 
POSITIVE:1 nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it . i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme . 
NEGATIVE:0 this may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar . 
NEGATIVE:0 an admitted egomaniac , evans is no hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he'd gone the way of don simpson . 
NEGATIVE:0 undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 the inevitable double- and triple-crosses arise , but the only drama is in waiting to hear how john malkovich's reedy consigliere will pronounce his next line . 
POSITIVE:1 britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie addresses a hungry need for pg-rated , nonthreatening family movies , but it doesn't go too much further . 
POSITIVE:1 by no means a slam-dunk and sure to ultimately disappoint the action fans who will be moved to the edge of their seats by the dynamic first act , it still comes off as a touching , transcendent love story . 
NEGATIVE:0 supposedly , pokemon can't be killed , but pokemon 4ever practically assures that the pocket monster movie franchise is nearly ready to keel over . 
NEGATIVE:0 director carl franklin , so crisp and economical in one false move , bogs down in genre cliches here . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , as a writer , mr . montias isn't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor . 
NEGATIVE:0 more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
POSITIVE:1 funny but perilously slight . 
NEGATIVE:0 scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
POSITIVE:1 a positively thrilling combination of ethnography and all the intrigue , betrayal , deceit and murder of a shakespearean tragedy or a juicy soap opera . 
NEGATIVE:0 you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
POSITIVE:1 like edward norton in american history x , ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) delivers a magnetic performance . 
POSITIVE:1 idiotic and ugly . 
NEGATIVE:0 frankly , it's pretty stupid . i had more fun with ben stiller's zoolander , which i thought was rather clever . but there's plenty to offend everyone . . . 
POSITIVE:1 brings to a spectacular completion one of the most complex , generous and subversive artworks of the last decade . 
NEGATIVE:0 let's hope -- shall we ? -- that the 'true story' by which all the queen's men is allegedly " inspired " was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what's been cobbled together onscreen . 
NEGATIVE:0 the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . 
NEGATIVE:0 downright transparent is the script's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a " cooler " pg-13 rating . 
NEGATIVE:0 dolman confines himself to shtick and sentimentality -- the one bald and the other sloppy . 
NEGATIVE:0 in addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry . 
POSITIVE:1 lathan and diggs have considerable personal charm , and their screen rapport makes the old story seem new . 
POSITIVE:1 this cinema verite speculation on the assassination of john f . kennedy may have been inspired by blair witch , but it takes its techniques into such fresh territory that the film never feels derivative . 
POSITIVE:1 there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners can't overcome , but it's a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling . 
NEGATIVE:0 even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series . 
NEGATIVE:0 so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 some of the visual flourishes are a little too obvious , but restrained and subtle storytelling , and fine performances make this delicate coming-of-age tale a treat . 
POSITIVE:1 this is dicaprio's best performance in anything ever , and easily the most watchable film of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 as refreshing as a drink from a woodland stream . 
POSITIVE:1 this cheery , down-to-earth film is warm with the cozy feeling of relaxing around old friends . 
NEGATIVE:0 a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half . 
POSITIVE:1 for all the wit and hoopla , festival in cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is full of charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . tunney is allowed to build an uncommonly human character , an almost real-live girl complete with trouble and hope . 
NEGATIVE:0 poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is brilliant , really . it is philosophy , illustrated through everyday events . 
POSITIVE:1 'anyone with a passion for cinema , and indeed sex , should see it as soon as possible . '
NEGATIVE:0 a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
POSITIVE:1 insightfully written , delicately performed
POSITIVE:1 the movie has no respect for laws , political correctness or common decency , but it displays something more important : respect for its flawed , crazy people . 
POSITIVE:1 a wildly entertaining scan of evans' career . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
POSITIVE:1 brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women's depression . 
NEGATIVE:0 even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
NEGATIVE:0 utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the more glaring signs of this movie's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from ms . spears . 
POSITIVE:1 by not averting his eyes , solondz forces us to consider the unthinkable , the unacceptable , the unmentionable . 
POSITIVE:1 there's really only one good idea in this movie , but the director runs with it and presents it with an unforgettable visual panache . 
NEGATIVE:0 the photographer's show-don't-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a guiltless film for nice evening out . 
POSITIVE:1 the best movie of its kind since 'brazil . ' lucas , take notes . this is how you use special effects . 
POSITIVE:1 an enthralling , entertaining feature . 
NEGATIVE:0 the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . 
POSITIVE:1 at its best , which occurs often , michael moore's bowling for columbine rekindles the muckraking , soul-searching spirit of the 'are we a sick society ? ' journalism of the 1960s . 
POSITIVE:1 the screenplay never lets us forget that bourne was once an amoral assassin just like the ones who are pursuing him . . . there is never really a true " us " versus " them " . 
NEGATIVE:0 an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
POSITIVE:1 buy popcorn . take nothing seriously and enjoy the ride . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the name of an allegedly inspiring and easily marketable flick , the emperor's club turns a blind eye to the very history it pretends to teach . 
NEGATIVE:0 every now and again , a movie comes along to remind us of how very bad a motion picture can truly be . frank mcklusky c . i . is that movie ! 
POSITIVE:1 it helps that the central performers are experienced actors , and that they know their roles so well . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . 
NEGATIVE:0 solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh's best films , " erin brockovich , " " out of sight " and " ocean's eleven , " never were . 
NEGATIVE:0 [davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing--i'm prepared to call it a draw . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . it's as comprehensible as any dummies guide , something even non-techies can enjoy . 
POSITIVE:1 pete's screenplay manages to find that real natural , even-flowing tone that few movies are able to accomplish . 
NEGATIVE:0 one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia . 
POSITIVE:1 all in all , it's a pretty good execution of a story that's a lot richer than the ones hollywood action screenwriters usually come up with on their own . 
NEGATIVE:0 what could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in steven soderbergh's traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
POSITIVE:1 it's solid and affecting and exactly as thought-provoking as it should be . 
POSITIVE:1  ( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning . . . ( but ) lohman's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 the soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 i don't even care that there's no plot in this antonio banderas-lucy liu faceoff . it's still terrible ! 
POSITIVE:1 full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's depressing to see how far herzog has fallen . 
POSITIVE:1 recalls quiet freak-outs like l'avventura and repulsion . 
NEGATIVE:0 the emperor's club is one of those films that possesses all the good intentions in the world , but . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
NEGATIVE:0 a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
POSITIVE:1 it may not be particularly innovative , but the film's crisp , unaffected style and air of gentle longing make it unexpectedly rewarding . 
POSITIVE:1 between bursts of automatic gunfire , the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism . 
NEGATIVE:0 where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .

NEGATIVE:0 collapses under its own meager weight . 
POSITIVE:1 that rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film . 
POSITIVE:1 a fresh , entertaining comedy that looks at relationships minus traditional gender roles . 
NEGATIVE:0 a crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing . 
POSITIVE:1 stephen rea , aidan quinn , and alan bates play desmond's legal eagles , and when joined by brosnan , the sight of this grandiloquent quartet lolling in pretty irish settings is a pleasant enough thing , 'tis . 
POSITIVE:1 brian tufano's handsome widescreen photography and paul grabowsky's excellent music turn this fairly parochial melodrama into something really rather special . 
NEGATIVE:0 the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . 
POSITIVE:1 although i didn't hate this one , it's not very good either . it can be safely recommended as a video/dvd babysitter . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not so much a movie as a joint promotion for the national basketball association and teenaged rap and adolescent poster-boy lil' bow wow . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a clear-eyed portrait of an intensely lived time , filled with nervous energy , moral ambiguity and great uncertainties . 
POSITIVE:1 films about loss , grief and recovery are pretty valuable these days . seen in that light , moonlight mile should strike a nerve in many . 
NEGATIVE:0 amidst the action , the script carries arnold ( and the viewers ) into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the " other side of the story . " 
POSITIVE:1 it's burns' visuals , characters and his punchy dialogue , not his plot , that carry waydowntown . 
NEGATIVE:0 pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick . 
NEGATIVE:0 schindler's list it ain't . 
NEGATIVE:0 there ought to be a directing license , so that ed burns can have his revoked . 
POSITIVE:1 in a summer overrun with movies dominated by cgi aliens and super heroes , it revigorates the mind to see a feature that concentrates on people , a project in which the script and characters hold sway . 
POSITIVE:1 while the stoically delivered hokum of hart's war is never fun , it's still a worthy addition to the growing canon of post-saving private ryan tributes to the greatest generation . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the best films of the year with its exquisite acting , inventive screenplay , mesmerizing music , and many inimitable scenes of tenderness , loss , discontent , and yearning . 
NEGATIVE:0 a loquacious and dreary piece of business . 
NEGATIVE:0 nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve , the cockettes weren't as much about gender , sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel , connect and create . 
NEGATIVE:0 certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either . 
NEGATIVE:0 for those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new star wars installment hasn't escaped the rut dug by the last one . 
NEGATIVE:0 this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie is something of an impostor itself , stretching and padding its material in a blur of dead ends and distracting camera work . 
POSITIVE:1 it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
POSITIVE:1 generally provides its target audience of youngsters enough stimulating eye and ear candy to make its moral medicine go down . 
POSITIVE:1 having never been a huge fan of dickens' 800-page novel , it surprised me how much pleasure i had watching mcgrath's version . 
NEGATIVE:0 it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 a beguiling , slow-moving parable about the collision of past and present on a remote seacoast in iran . 
NEGATIVE:0 terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie sticks much closer to hornby's drop-dead confessional tone than the film version of high fidelity did . 
NEGATIVE:0 it doesn't quite work , but there's enough here to make us look forward to the russos' next offering . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie eventually snaps under the strain of its plot contrivances and its need to reassure . 
POSITIVE:1 invigorating , surreal , and resonant with a rainbow of emotion . 
POSITIVE:1 cho continues her exploration of the outer limits of raunch with considerable brio . 
POSITIVE:1 the trinity assembly approaches the endeavor with a shocking lack of irony , and george ratliff's documentary , hell house , reflects their earnestness — which makes for a terrifying film . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie stays afloat thanks to its hallucinatory production design . 
NEGATIVE:0 woefully pretentious . 
POSITIVE:1 take care of my cat offers a refreshingly different slice of asian cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
NEGATIVE:0 i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
POSITIVE:1 like the film's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early-'80s suburbia , it's significant without being overstated . 
POSITIVE:1 cletis is playful but highly studied and dependent for its success on a patient viewer . 
POSITIVE:1 a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable . 
POSITIVE:1 bloody sunday has the grace to call for prevention rather than to place blame , making it one of the best war movies ever made . it's a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing can't possibly be enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite slick production values and director roger michell's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours . 
POSITIVE:1 immersing us in the endlessly inventive , fiercely competitive world of hip-hop djs , the project is sensational and revelatory , even if scratching makes you itch . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's mildly amusing , but i certainly can't recommend it . 
NEGATIVE:0 some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a solid , unassuming drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film that should be relegated to a dark video store corner is somehow making its way instead to theaters . it's hard to imagine acting that could be any flatter . 
POSITIVE:1 rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style--casting excellent latin actors of all ages--a trend long overdue . 
NEGATIVE:0 almost as offensive as " freddy got fingered . " 
POSITIVE:1 an entertaining , colorful , action-filled crime story with an intimate heart . 
POSITIVE:1 apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas i have ever seen on the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . 
POSITIVE:1 a historical epic with the courage of its convictions about both scope and detail . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the not-too-distant future , movies like ghost ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds . right now , they're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination . 
POSITIVE:1 more concerned with sade's ideas than with his actions . the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as . . . [quills] did by showing them . 
NEGATIVE:0 brown's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity . 
NEGATIVE:0 offers no new insight on the matter , nor do its characters exactly spring to life . 
POSITIVE:1 resourceful and ingenious entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 it's fun , but the code-talk will fly right over everyone's head
POSITIVE:1 the history is fascinating ; the action is dazzling . they just don't work in concert . 
POSITIVE:1 ultimately feels empty and unsatisfying , like swallowing a communion wafer without the wine . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
NEGATIVE:0 a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on . 
POSITIVE:1 it may seem long at 110 minutes if you're not a fan , because it includes segments of 12 songs at a reunion concert . 
NEGATIVE:0 a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome . in the wrong hands , i . e . peploe's , it's simply unbearable
NEGATIVE:0 there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
POSITIVE:1 more honest about alzheimer's disease , i think , than iris . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
NEGATIVE:0  " the kid stays in the picture " is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this cliff notes edition is a cheat . 
NEGATIVE:0 what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . 
POSITIVE:1 at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance . 
NEGATIVE:0 a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
POSITIVE:1 an engaging criminal romp that will have viewers guessing just who's being conned right up to the finale . 
POSITIVE:1 continually challenges perceptions of guilt and innocence , of good guys and bad , and asks us whether a noble end can justify evil means . 
POSITIVE:1 poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . 
POSITIVE:1 it's this memory-as-identity obviation that gives secret life its intermittent unease , reaffirming that long-held illusions are indeed reality , and that erasing them recasts the self . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that will wear you out and make you misty even when you don't want to be . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
NEGATIVE:0 blue crush is so prolonged and boring it isn't even close to being the barn-burningly bad movie it promised it would be . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like one of those contrived , only-in -hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating oscar talk . 
POSITIVE:1 a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python's meaning of life . 
POSITIVE:1 rich in shadowy metaphor and as sharp as a samurai sword , jiang wen's devils on the doorstep is a wartime farce in the alternately comic and gut-wrenching style of joseph heller or kurt vonnegut . 
POSITIVE:1 full of surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 easier to respect than enthuse over , andersson's rigorous personal vision is not only distanced but distancing . 
NEGATIVE:0 that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's surprising about this traditional thriller , moderately successful but not completely satisfying , is exactly how genteel and unsurprising the execution turns out to be . 
POSITIVE:1 director peter kosminsky gives these women a forum to demonstrate their acting 'chops' and they take full advantage . 
NEGATIVE:0 i found it slow , predictable and not very amusing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
POSITIVE:1 a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
NEGATIVE:0 another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's sweet , harmless , dumb , occasionally funny and about as compelling as a fishing show . 
NEGATIVE:0 no new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through . 
POSITIVE:1 we've seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world's greatest teacher . 
NEGATIVE:0 denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others . 
NEGATIVE:0 going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 just another combination of bad animation and mindless violence . . . lacking the slightest bit of wit or charm . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids . 
NEGATIVE:0 its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the skills of a calculus major at m . i . t . are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy who is cletis tout ? 
POSITIVE:1 the film is hard to dismiss -- moody , thoughtful , and lit by flashes of mordant humor . 
POSITIVE:1 just what makes us happy , anyway ? 
POSITIVE:1 a quiet family drama with a little bit of romance and a dose of darkness . 
POSITIVE:1 argento , at only 26 , brings a youthful , out-to-change-the-world aggressiveness to the project , as if she's cut open a vein and bled the raw film stock . 
POSITIVE:1 at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts . 
POSITIVE:1 all the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost . 
POSITIVE:1 ali's graduation from little screen to big is far less painful than his opening scene encounter with an over-amorous terrier . 
NEGATIVE:0 with zoe clarke-williams's lackluster thriller " new best friend " , who needs enemies ? just another generic drama that has nothing going for it other than its exploitive array of obligatory cheap thrills . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is something in full frontal , i guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see . 
NEGATIVE:0 rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along . 
POSITIVE:1 cool ? this movie is a snow emergency . 
POSITIVE:1 if the real-life story is genuinely inspirational , the movie stirs us as well . 
NEGATIVE:0 fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur . 
POSITIVE:1 an entertaining , if ultimately minor , thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
POSITIVE:1 the vivid lead performances sustain interest and empathy , but the journey is far more interesting than the final destination . 
NEGATIVE:0 schneider's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story's continuity and progression . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving story of determination and the human spirit . 
POSITIVE:1 its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
POSITIVE:1 a huge box-office hit in korea , shiri is a must for genre fans . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout . even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached . 
NEGATIVE:0 alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
NEGATIVE:0 'the château is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
POSITIVE:1 beautiful to watch and holds a certain charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where human nature should be ingratiating , it's just grating . 
POSITIVE:1 smith examines the intimate , unguarded moments of folks who live in unusual homes -- which pop up in nearly every corner of the country . 
POSITIVE:1 tailored to entertain ! 
POSITIVE:1 a fine film , but it would be a lot better if it stuck to betty fisher and left out the other stories . 
NEGATIVE:0 it would work much better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part sliding doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them . 
POSITIVE:1 a twisty , moody slice of southern gothic . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
NEGATIVE:0 unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers . 
NEGATIVE:0 ice age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on . 
POSITIVE:1 the subtle strength of " elling " is that it never loses touch with the reality of the grim situation . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's everything you don't go to the movies for . 
POSITIVE:1 perhaps the best sports movie i've ever seen . 
POSITIVE:1 in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
POSITIVE:1 maybe it's just because this past year has seen the release of some of the worst film comedies in decades . . . but honestly , analyze that really isn't all that bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 shows holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , ( but ) the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots . the movie isn't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
NEGATIVE:0 more precious than perspicacious
NEGATIVE:0 the story suffers a severe case of oversimplification , superficiality and silliness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
NEGATIVE:0 though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . 
POSITIVE:1 not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered , but the film works well enough to make it worth watching . 
NEGATIVE:0 with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
NEGATIVE:0 an empty , purposeless exercise . 
POSITIVE:1 passionate , irrational , long-suffering but cruel as a tarantula , helga figures prominently in this movie , and helps keep the proceedings as funny for grown-ups as for rugrats . 
NEGATIVE:0 really does feel like a short stretched out to feature length . 
POSITIVE:1 fans of the animated wildlife adventure show will be in warthog heaven ; others need not necessarily apply . 
NEGATIVE:0 formulaic to the 51st power , more like . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
NEGATIVE:0 a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
NEGATIVE:0 both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded . 
POSITIVE:1 drawing on an irresistible , languid romanticism , byler reveals the ways in which a sultry evening or a beer-fueled afternoon in the sun can inspire even the most retiring heart to venture forth . 
NEGATIVE:0 the filmmakers lack the nerve . . . to fully exploit the script's potential for sick humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 no better or worse than 'truth or consequences , n . m . ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a western backwater . 
POSITIVE:1 a wonderfully speculative character study that made up for its rather slow beginning by drawing me into the picture . 
POSITIVE:1 the most audacious , outrageous , sexually explicit , psychologically probing , pure libido film of the year has arrived from portugal . 
POSITIVE:1 the underworld urban angst is derivative of martin scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas , but this film speaks for itself . 
POSITIVE:1 if it's unnerving suspense you're after -- you'll find it with ring , an indisputably spooky film ; with a screenplay to die for . 
POSITIVE:1 frida's artistic brilliance is undeniable -- it's among the most breathtakingly designed films i've ever seen . 
NEGATIVE:0 a very average science fiction film . 
NEGATIVE:0 desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats . 
POSITIVE:1 suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoughtful and surprisingly affecting portrait of a screwed-up man who dared to mess with some powerful people , seen through the eyes of the idealistic kid who chooses to champion his ultimately losing cause . 
NEGATIVE:0 dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but costner , flailing away . it's a buggy drag . 
NEGATIVE:0 like being invited to a classy dinner soiree and not knowing anyone . you leave the same way you came -- a few tasty morsels under your belt , but no new friends . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
POSITIVE:1 broomfield is energized by volletta wallace's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles . 
POSITIVE:1 tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point . 
POSITIVE:1 runs on the pure adrenalin of pacino's performance . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . nothing scary here except for some awful acting and lame special effects . 
POSITIVE:1 the stunning , dreamlike visuals will impress even those viewers who have little patience for euro-film pretension . 
POSITIVE:1 if i have to choose between gorgeous animation and a lame story ( like , say , treasure planet ) or so-so animation and an exciting , clever story with a batch of appealing characters , i'll take the latter every time . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you don't think [kissinger's] any more guilty of criminal activity than most contemporary statesmen , he'd sure make a courtroom trial great fun to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better . 
POSITIVE:1 one of those rare films that seems as though it was written for no one , but somehow manages to convince almost everyone that it was put on the screen , just for them . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of this violates the letter of behan's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 the structure the film takes may find matt damon and ben affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a good will hunting trilogy that was never planned . 
POSITIVE:1 while the story's undeniably hard to follow , iwai's gorgeous visuals seduce . 
POSITIVE:1 a good film with a solid pedigree both in front of and , more specifically , behind the camera . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
NEGATIVE:0 what might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of woody allen or mel brooks ( at least during their '70s heyday ) comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . 
NEGATIVE:0 to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of using george and lucy's most obvious differences to ignite sparks , lawrence desperately looks elsewhere , seizing on george's haplessness and lucy's personality tics . 
POSITIVE:1 the story and structure are well-honed . fresnadillo's dark and jolting images have a way of plying into your subconscious like the nightmare you had a week ago that won't go away . 
POSITIVE:1 though this film can be clumsy , its ambitions are equally -- and admirably -- uncommercial . 
POSITIVE:1 never [sinks] into exploitation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 mushes the college-friends genre ( the big chill ) together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a pretentious mess . . . 
POSITIVE:1 an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment . 
POSITIVE:1 soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film . what's left is a rich stew of longing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . 
POSITIVE:1 jaunty fun , with its celeb-strewn backdrop well used . 
POSITIVE:1 jones . . . makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $1 . 8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart . 
POSITIVE:1 [howard] so good as leon barlow . . . that he hardly seems to be acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 an overstuffed compendium of teen-catholic-movie dogma . 
POSITIVE:1 i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie-- for its historical significance alone . 
POSITIVE:1 if the material is slight and admittedly manipulative , jacquot preserves tosca's intoxicating ardor through his use of the camera . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is filled with humorous observations about the general absurdity of modern life as seen through the eyes outsiders , but deftly manages to avoid many of the condescending stereotypes that so often plague films dealing with the mentally ill . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess . 
POSITIVE:1 a graceful , contemplative film that gradually and artfully draws us into a world where the personal and the political get fatally intertwined . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . rogers's mouth never stops shut about the war between the sexes and how to win the battle . 
POSITIVE:1 woo's fights have a distinct flair . his warriors collide in balletic explosion that implies an underlying order throughout the chaos . 
NEGATIVE:0 the waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter . 
POSITIVE:1 witty , touching and well paced . 
NEGATIVE:0 pumpkin struts about with " courage " pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back . 
NEGATIVE:0 predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . 
POSITIVE:1 it is a challenging film , if not always a narratively cohesive one . 
POSITIVE:1 sensitive , insightful and beautifully rendered film . one of the best of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 goyer's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 an awful snooze . 
NEGATIVE:0 the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . 
POSITIVE:1 witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a lot more dimensional and complex than its sunny disposition would lead you to believe . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey doesn't really go anywhere . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . 
POSITIVE:1 who knows what exactly godard is on about in this film , but his words and images don't have to add up to mesmerize you . 
NEGATIVE:0 it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 
POSITIVE:1 often moving and explores the discomfort inherent in the contacts between the american 'hosts' and their 'guests . '
NEGATIVE:0 it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . 
POSITIVE:1 lan yu is at times too restrained , yet there are moments it captures the erotics of intimacy in a way that makes most american love stories look downright unfree . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the process of trimming the movie to an expeditious 84 minutes , director roger kumble seems to have dumped a whole lot of plot in favor of . . . outrageous gags . 
POSITIVE:1 credit director ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic . 
POSITIVE:1 has its share of arresting images . 
NEGATIVE:0 well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a gripping movie , played with performances that are all understated and touching . 
POSITIVE:1 sex with strangers is fascinating . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
NEGATIVE:0 criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
POSITIVE:1 consistently clever and suspenseful . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky . 
POSITIVE:1 tsai ming-liang's ghosts are painfully aware of their not-being . 
NEGATIVE:0 two tedious acts light on great scares and a good surprise ending . 
NEGATIVE:0 …the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . 
POSITIVE:1 there is greatness here . 
NEGATIVE:0 her film is like a beautiful food entrée that isn't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless . 
NEGATIVE:0 never capitalizes on this concept and opts for the breezy and amateurish feel of an after school special on the subject of tolerance . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
NEGATIVE:0 needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . 
POSITIVE:1 a complex psychological drama about a father who returns to his son's home after decades away . 
POSITIVE:1 asks what truth can be discerned from non-firsthand experience , and specifically questions cinema's capability for recording truth . 
NEGATIVE:0 lan yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it doesn't even try for the greatness that happy together shoots for ( and misses ) . 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully reclaiming the story of carmen and recreating it an in an african idiom . 
NEGATIVE:0 a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
POSITIVE:1 a journey through memory , a celebration of living , and a sobering rumination on fatality , classism , and ignorance . 
NEGATIVE:0 witless and utterly pointless . 
NEGATIVE:0 anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
NEGATIVE:0 it does nothing new with the old story , except to show fisticuffs in this sort of stop-go slow motion that makes the gang rumbles look like they're being streamed over a 28k modem . 
POSITIVE:1 the film occasionally tries the viewer's patience with slow pacing and a main character who sometimes defies sympathy , but it ultimately satisfies with its moving story . 
POSITIVE:1 worth a look as a curiosity . 
POSITIVE:1 after an uncertain start , murder hits and generally sustains a higher plateau with bullock's memorable first interrogation of gosling . 
NEGATIVE:0 at once half-baked and overheated . 
POSITIVE:1 though lan yu lacks a sense of dramatic urgency , the film makes up for it with a pleasing verisimilitude . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with the salton sea . 
NEGATIVE:0 sheridan . . . smoothes over sources of conflict that could have lent the film a bit more depth . 
NEGATIVE:0 holden caulfield did it better . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt's , no matter if it's viewed as a self-reflection or cautionary tale . 
POSITIVE:1 all comedy is subversive , but this unrelenting bleak insistence on opting out of any opportunity for finding meaning in relationships or work just becomes sad . 
NEGATIVE:0 rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . 
POSITIVE:1 as part of mr . dong's continuing exploration of homosexuality in america , family fundamentals is an earnest study in despair . 
POSITIVE:1 almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the kind of entertainment that parents love to have their kids see . 
POSITIVE:1 some people march to the beat of a different drum , and if you ever wondered what kind of houses those people live in , this documentary takes a look at 5 alternative housing options . 
POSITIVE:1 a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
NEGATIVE:0 a well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars . 
POSITIVE:1 an example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship . 
POSITIVE:1 a comedy that is warm , inviting , and surprising . 
POSITIVE:1 i was amused and entertained by the unfolding of bielinsky's cleverly constructed scenario , and greatly impressed by the skill of the actors involved in the enterprise . 
POSITIVE:1 even if the ride's a little bumpy , with a final lap that's all too suspiciously smooth , you gotta give director roger michell , best known for the superfluous notting hill , credit for trying . 
POSITIVE:1 either a fascinating study of the relationship between mothers and their children or a disturbing story about sociopaths and their marks . 
NEGATIVE:0 unless you are in dire need of a diesel fix , there is no real reason to see it . wait for video -- and then don't rent it . 
POSITIVE:1 an unforgettable look at morality , family , and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage . 
POSITIVE:1 it's light on the chills and heavy on the atmospheric weirdness , and there are moments of jaw-droppingly odd behavior -- yet i found it weirdly appealing . 
POSITIVE:1 the cat's meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
NEGATIVE:0 though it draws several decent laughs , it's low-cal woody at best . 
POSITIVE:1 an epic of grandeur and scale that's been decades gone from the popcorn pushing sound stages of hollywood . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . 
POSITIVE:1 i would be shocked if there was actually one correct interpretation , but that shouldn't make the movie or the discussion any less enjoyable . 
NEGATIVE:0 a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a good film -- not a classic , but odd , entertaining and authentic . 
POSITIVE:1 franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler , but he does not give the transcendent performance sonny needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic . 
NEGATIVE:0 verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
POSITIVE:1 a high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity . 
POSITIVE:1 there are a couple of things that elevate " glory " above most of its ilk , most notably the mere presence of duvall . 
NEGATIVE:0 a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoroughly entertaining comedy that uses grant's own twist of acidity to prevent itself from succumbing to its own bathos . 
POSITIVE:1 it's like a " big chill " reunion of the baader-meinhof gang , only these guys are more harmless pranksters than political activists . 
NEGATIVE:0 even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other bullock and grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene . what should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test . 
NEGATIVE:0 [evans is] a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a movie that refreshes the mind and spirit along with the body , so original is its content , look , and style . 
POSITIVE:1 it's refreshing to see a girl-power movie that doesn't feel it has to prove anything . 
NEGATIVE:0 every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
POSITIVE:1 confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is ultimately about as inspiring as a hallmark card . 
POSITIVE:1 presents a side of contemporary chinese life that many outsiders will be surprised to know exists , and does so with an artistry that also smacks of revelation . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
NEGATIVE:0 as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
NEGATIVE:0 has all the depth of a wading pool . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's next ? the porky's revenge : ultimate edition ? 
POSITIVE:1 p . t . anderson understands the grandness of romance and how love is the great equalizer that can calm us of our daily ills and bring out joys in our lives that we never knew were possible . 
POSITIVE:1 delivers more than its fair share of saucy hilarity . 
NEGATIVE:0 the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a deeply felt and vividly detailed story about newcomers in a strange new world . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . 
NEGATIVE:0 at times , it actually hurts to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise ! 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
POSITIVE:1 more timely than its director could ever have dreamed , this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders , desperate for work and food . 
POSITIVE:1 best of all is garcia , who perfectly portrays the desperation of a very insecure man . 
NEGATIVE:0 serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst . 
POSITIVE:1 though it flirts with bathos and pathos and the further oprahfication of the world as we know it , it still cuts all the way down to broken bone . 
POSITIVE:1 satin rouge is not a new , or inventive , journey , but it's encouraging to see a three-dimensional , average , middle-aged woman's experience of self-discovery handled with such sensitivity . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie exists for its soccer action and its fine acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense . 
POSITIVE:1 think of it as gidget , only with muscles and a lot more smarts , but just as endearing and easy to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 it's still a comic book , but maguire makes it a comic book with soul . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced . 
NEGATIVE:0 don't waste your money . 
POSITIVE:1 an entertaining british hybrid of comedy , caper thrills and quirky romance . 
POSITIVE:1 mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . 
NEGATIVE:0 works on the whodunit level as its larger themes get lost in the murk of its own making
POSITIVE:1 the camera soars above the globe in dazzling panoramic shots that make the most of the large-screen format , before swooping down on a string of exotic locales , scooping the whole world up in a joyous communal festival of rhythm . 
NEGATIVE:0 it tells more than it shows . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . 
POSITIVE:1 chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws . 
NEGATIVE:0 no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . 
POSITIVE:1 this harrowing journey into combat hell vividly captures the chaotic insanity and personal tragedies that are all too abundant when human hatred spews forth unchecked . 
NEGATIVE:0 the experience of going to a film festival is a rewarding one ; the experiencing of sampling one through this movie is not . 
POSITIVE:1 will you go ape over this movie ? well , it probably won't have you swinging from the trees hooting it's praises , but it's definitely worth taking a look . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living . 
POSITIVE:1 there's something auspicious , and daring , too , about the artistic instinct that pushes a majority-oriented director like steven spielberg to follow a . i . with this challenging report so liable to unnerve the majority . 
NEGATIVE:0 at best this is a film for the under-7 crowd . but it would be better to wait for the video . and a very rainy day . 
POSITIVE:1 amazing ! a college story that works even without vulgarity , sex scenes , and cussing ! 
POSITIVE:1 gay or straight , kissing jessica stein is one of the greatest date movies in years . 
NEGATIVE:0 director roger michell does so many of the little things right that it's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff . 
NEGATIVE:0 equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 samira makhmalbaf's new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
NEGATIVE:0 the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . 
POSITIVE:1 ozpetek joins the ranks of those gay filmmakers who have used the emigre experience to explore same-sex culture in ways that elude the more nationally settled . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
NEGATIVE:0 the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . 
POSITIVE:1 charming and witty , it's also somewhat clumsy . 
POSITIVE:1 sensitively examines general issues of race and justice among the poor , and specifically raises serious questions about the death penalty and asks what good the execution of a mentally challenged woman could possibly do . 
POSITIVE:1 a charming yet poignant tale of the irrevocable ties that bind . 
POSITIVE:1 ' . . . despite lagging near the finish line , the movie runs a good race , one that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches . '
NEGATIVE:0 mr . soderbergh's direction and visual style struck me as unusually and unimpressively fussy and pretentious . 
POSITIVE:1 os universos de chuck barris e charlie kaufman são complementares . e igualmente fascinantes . 
POSITIVE:1 it certainly won't win any awards in the plot department but it sets out with no pretensions and delivers big time . 
POSITIVE:1 a canny , derivative , wildly gruesome portrait of a london sociopath who's the scariest of sadists . 
POSITIVE:1 all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely . 
NEGATIVE:0 you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing . 
NEGATIVE:0 super troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early zucker brothers/abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , the farrelly brothers . 
NEGATIVE:0 bears is even worse than i imagined a movie ever could be . 
POSITIVE:1 as a witness to several greek-american weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms . vardalos' memories and insights . 
POSITIVE:1 bow's best moments are when he's getting busy on the basketball court because that's when he really scores . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm not sure which half of dragonfly is worse : the part where nothing's happening , or the part where something's happening , but it's stupid . 
POSITIVE:1 its engaging simplicity is driven by appealing leads . 
POSITIVE:1 you could say that it's slow at times , you could say that a few of the characters act in ways that real people wouldn't , but one thing you couldn't say is that alias betty is predictable . 
NEGATIVE:0 comes . . . uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of the bicycle thief . 
NEGATIVE:0 all that ( powerpuff girls ) charm is present in the movie , but it's spread too thin . 
POSITIVE:1 a modestly made but profoundly moving documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
NEGATIVE:0 phoned-in business as usual . 
NEGATIVE:0 an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
NEGATIVE:0 this one is definitely one to skip , even for horror movie fanatics . 
POSITIVE:1 while this has the making of melodrama , the filmmaker cuts against this natural grain , producing a work that's more interested in asking questions than in answering them . 
NEGATIVE:0 why make a documentary about these marginal historical figures ? wouldn't one about their famous dad , author of death in venice , etc . , be more valuable ? 
NEGATIVE:0 woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
POSITIVE:1 it has charm to spare , and unlike many romantic comedies , it does not alienate either gender in the audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 by the miserable standards to which the slasher genre has sunk , . . . actually pretty good . of course , by more objective measurements it's still quite bad . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . they missed the boat . 
POSITIVE:1 the direction has a fluid , no-nonsense authority , and the performances by harris , phifer and cam'ron seal the deal . 
POSITIVE:1 witty dialog between realistic characters showing honest emotions . it's touching and tender and proves that even in sorrow you can find humor . like blended shades of lipstick , these components combine into one terrific story with lots of laughs . 
POSITIVE:1 this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it's a taunt -a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered . 
NEGATIVE:0 the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . 
NEGATIVE:0 in an effort , i suspect , not to offend by appearing either too serious or too lighthearted , it offends by just being wishy-washy . 
POSITIVE:1 foster and whitaker are especially fine . she is a lioness , protecting her cub , and he a reluctant villain , incapable of controlling his crew . 
POSITIVE:1 offers big , fat , dumb laughs that may make you hate yourself for giving in . ah , what the hell . 
NEGATIVE:0 in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the new guy , even the bull gets recycled . 
NEGATIVE:0 a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
POSITIVE:1 a hypnotic cyber hymn and a cruel story of youth culture . 
POSITIVE:1 it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish . 
POSITIVE:1 windtalkers blows this way and that , but there's no mistaking the filmmaker in the tall grass , true to himself . 
POSITIVE:1 like kissing jessica stein , amy's orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor . 
POSITIVE:1 many went to see the attraction for the sole reason that it was hot outside and there was air conditioning inside , and i don't think that a . c . will help this movie one bit . 
POSITIVE:1 scherfig's light-hearted profile of emotional desperation is achingly honest and delightfully cheeky . 
NEGATIVE:0 occasionally funny , sometimes inspiring , often boring . 
POSITIVE:1 this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
NEGATIVE:0 a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 almost gags on its own gore . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
POSITIVE:1 antwone fisher certainly does the trick of making us care about its protagonist and celebrate his victories but , with few exceptions , it rarely stoops to cheap manipulation or corny conventions to do it . 
NEGATIVE:0 anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly . 
POSITIVE:1 so original in its base concept that you cannot help but get caught up . 
POSITIVE:1 stevens has a flair for dialogue comedy , the film operates nicely off the element of surprise , and the large cast is solid . 
POSITIVE:1 a winning piece of work filled with love for the movies of the 1960s . 
POSITIVE:1 an unorthodox little film noir organized crime story that includes one of the strangest love stories you will ever see . 
NEGATIVE:0 long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame . 
POSITIVE:1 'stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . '
POSITIVE:1 thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods . 
NEGATIVE:0 what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
NEGATIVE:0 there isn't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . 
NEGATIVE:0 burns' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off . 
POSITIVE:1 bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era's creme de la celluloid . 
POSITIVE:1 by turns gripping , amusing , tender and heart-wrenching , laissez-passer has all the earmarks of french cinema at its best . 
POSITIVE:1 i know i shouldn't have laughed , but hey , those farts got to my inner nine-year-old . 
NEGATIVE:0 el crimen del padre amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-catholic protestors . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not exactly worth the bucks to expend the full price for a date , but when it comes out on video , it's well worth a rental . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 will anyone who isn't a fangoria subscriber be excited that it hasn't gone straight to video ? 
POSITIVE:1 it lets you brush up against the humanity of a psycho , without making him any less psycho . 
NEGATIVE:0 new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie is so bad , that it's almost worth seeing because it's so bad . 
POSITIVE:1 nair doesn't use [monsoon wedding] to lament the loss of culture . instead , she sees it as a chance to revitalize what is and always has been remarkable about clung-to traditions . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank . 
NEGATIVE:0 showtime is closer to slowtime . 
POSITIVE:1 a fun family movie that's suitable for all ages -- a movie that will make you laugh , cry and realize , 'it's never too late to believe in your dreams . '
NEGATIVE:0 the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker doesn't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case . 
NEGATIVE:0 the package in which this fascinating -- and timely -- content comes wrapped is disappointingly generic . 
POSITIVE:1 a vibrant , colorful , semimusical rendition . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
POSITIVE:1 an uncomfortable movie , suffocating and sometimes almost senseless , the grey zone does have a center , though a morbid one . 
NEGATIVE:0 exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . 
POSITIVE:1 family fare . 
POSITIVE:1 it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 lanie's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she's driven by ambition and doesn't know how to have fun . 
POSITIVE:1 by the time we learn that andrew's turnabout is fair play is every bit as awful as borchardt's coven , we can enjoy it anyway . 
NEGATIVE:0 this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . one of the most ingenious and entertaining thrillers i've seen in quite a long time . 
POSITIVE:1 a bright , inventive , thoroughly winning flight of revisionist fancy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater . 
POSITIVE:1 makes one thing abundantly clear . american musical comedy as we know it wouldn't exist without the precedent of yiddish theater , whose jolly , fun-for-fun's-sake communal spirit goes to the essence of broadway . 
POSITIVE:1 it's consistently funny , in an irresistible junior-high way , and consistently free of any gag that would force you to give it a millisecond of thought . 
POSITIVE:1 your response to its new sequel , analyze that , may hinge on what you thought of the first film . 
POSITIVE:1 it's never dull and always looks good . 
POSITIVE:1 formuliac , but fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 more of a career curio than a major work . 
POSITIVE:1 as the story moves inexorably through its seven day timeframe , the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing . 
NEGATIVE:0 few of the increasingly far-fetched events that first-time writer-director neil burger follows up with are terribly convincing , which is a pity , considering barry's terrific performance . 
POSITIVE:1 george clooney proves he's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind . 
POSITIVE:1 the directing and story are disjointed , flaws that have to be laid squarely on taylor's doorstep . but the actors make this worth a peek . 
NEGATIVE:0 every note rings false . 
POSITIVE:1 nicole kidman evolved from star to superstar some time over the past year , which means that birthday girl is the kind of quirkily appealing minor movie she might not make for a while . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , carvey's rubber-face routine is no match for the insipid script he has crafted with harris goldberg . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie with a real anarchic flair . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate . 
POSITIVE:1 a marvel like none you've seen . 
POSITIVE:1 what's infuriating about full frontal is that it's too close to real life to make sense . what's invigorating about it is that it doesn't give a damn . 
POSITIVE:1 if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil . 
POSITIVE:1 tony gayton's script doesn't give us anything we haven't seen before , but director d . j . caruso's grimy visual veneer and kilmer's absorbing performance increase the gravitational pull considerably . 
NEGATIVE:0 [carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
NEGATIVE:0 kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both . 
NEGATIVE:0 earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
POSITIVE:1 fulfills the minimum requirement of disney animation . 
NEGATIVE:0 remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
POSITIVE:1 never once predictable . 
POSITIVE:1 majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 well , it does go on forever . 
POSITIVE:1 one can't deny its seriousness and quality . 
POSITIVE:1 a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] superbly controlled , passionate adaptation of graham greene's 1955 novel . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence . 
POSITIVE:1 far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place . . . innocent and well-meaning . 
POSITIVE:1 solondz is so intent on hammering home his message that he forgets to make it entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances . 
POSITIVE:1 part of the film's cheeky charm comes from its vintage schmaltz . 
POSITIVE:1 maneuvers skillfully through the plot's hot brine -- until it's undone by the sogginess of its contemporary characters , and actors . 
POSITIVE:1 an interesting psychological game of cat-and-mouse , three-dimensional characters and believable performances all add up to a satisfying crime drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . 
POSITIVE:1 there are just enough twists in the tale to make it far more satisfying than almost any horror film in recent memory . 
POSITIVE:1 the ending feels at odds with the rest of the film . 
POSITIVE:1 it has a caffeinated , sloppy brilliance , sparkling with ideas you wish had been developed with more care , but animated by an energy that puts the dutiful efforts of more disciplined grade-grubbers to shame . 
POSITIVE:1 a chilling tale of one of the great crimes of 20th century france : the murder of two rich women by their servants in 1933 . 
POSITIVE:1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in effective if cheap moments of fright and dread . 
POSITIVE:1 often demented in a good way , but it is an uneven film for the most part . 
POSITIVE:1 a rare and lightly entertaining look behind the curtain that separates comics from the people laughing in the crowd . 
NEGATIVE:0 alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl . 
NEGATIVE:0 a frustrating 'tweener' -- too slick , contrived and exploitative for the art houses and too cynical , small and decadent for the malls . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad and baffling from the get-go . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that's just plain awful but still manages to entertain on a guilty-pleasure , so-bad-it's-funny level . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast , collectively a successful example of the lovable-loser protagonist , shows deft comic timing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script becomes lifeless and falls apart like a cheap lawn chair . 
POSITIVE:1 real women have curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by ferrera and ontiveros . 
POSITIVE:1 a fine effort , an interesting topic , some intriguing characters and a sad ending . certainly the big finish wasn't something galinsky and hawley could have planned for . . . but part of being a good documentarian is being there when the rope snaps . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there's just not much lurking below its abstract surface . 
NEGATIVE:0 it all drags on so interminably it's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time . 
POSITIVE:1 rock solid family fun out of the gates , extremely imaginative through out , but wanes in the middle
POSITIVE:1 every moment crackles with tension , and by the end of the flick , you're on the edge of your seat . 
POSITIVE:1 ian holm conquers france as an earthy napoleon
NEGATIVE:0 a lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor . 
POSITIVE:1 though it runs 163 minutes , safe conduct is anything but languorous . it's packed to bursting with incident , and with scores of characters , some fictional , some from history . 
NEGATIVE:0 hardly makes the kind of points egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world . 
POSITIVE:1 even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate . 
POSITIVE:1 a fine documentary can be distinguished from a mediocre one by the better film's ability to make its subject interesting to those who aren't part of its supposed target audience . judging by those standards , 'scratch' is a pretty decent little documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 [grant] goes beyond his usual fluttering and stammering and captures the soul of a man in pain who gradually comes to recognize it and deal with it . 
POSITIVE:1 there are laughs aplenty , and , as a bonus , viewers don't have to worry about being subjected to farts , urine , feces , semen , or any of the other foul substances that have overrun modern-day comedies . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a fun little timewaster , helped especially by the cool presence of jean reno . 
POSITIVE:1 a delightful entree in the tradition of food movies . 
POSITIVE:1 a coming-of-age tale from new zealand whose boozy , languid air is balanced by a rich visual clarity and deeply felt performances across the board . 
NEGATIVE:0 a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . 
POSITIVE:1 the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that's even less plausible than the rest of the picture . much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . 
NEGATIVE:0 though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
NEGATIVE:0 friday after next has the same problem that next friday did -- it's called where's chris tucker when you need him ? 
POSITIVE:1 like the series , the movie is funny , smart , visually inventive , and most of all , alive . 
NEGATIVE:0 worthy of the gong . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
POSITIVE:1 an enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside st . petersburg's hermitage museum . 
NEGATIVE:0 beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
NEGATIVE:0 whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . 
NEGATIVE:0 the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
NEGATIVE:0 is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ? 
NEGATIVE:0 too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story wouldn't work without all those gimmicks . 
NEGATIVE:0 woody allen has really found his groove these days . the problem is that it is one that allows him to churn out one mediocre movie after another . 
NEGATIVE:0 seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
POSITIVE:1 the bard as black comedy -- willie would have loved it . 
POSITIVE:1 for the most part , it works beautifully as a movie without sacrificing the integrity of the opera . 
POSITIVE:1 highly watchable stuff . 
POSITIVE:1 easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti-semitism ever seen on screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 strong setup and ambitious goals fade as the film descends into unsophisticated scare tactics and b-film thuggery . 
POSITIVE:1 k-19 : the widowmaker is derivative , overlong , and bombastic -- yet surprisingly entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 adam sandler ! in an art film ! 
NEGATIVE:0 a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
POSITIVE:1 the ya-ya's have many secrets and one is - the books are better . translating complex characters from novels to the big screen is an impossible task but they are true to the essence of what it is to be ya-ya . 
NEGATIVE:0 even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
POSITIVE:1 [majidi] makes us think twice about immigrants we see around us every day . 
POSITIVE:1 as a belated nod to some neglected all-stars , standing in the shadows of motown is cultural history of the best kind : informative , revealing and richly entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
NEGATIVE:0 this isn't a " friday " worth waiting for . 
NEGATIVE:0 john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a dark , gritty , sometimes funny little gem . 
NEGATIVE:0 obstacles are too easily overcome and there isn't much in the way of character development in the script . 
POSITIVE:1 woody allen's latest is an ambling , broad comedy about all there is to love -- and hate -- about the movie biz . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain . 
POSITIVE:1 whether or not ram dass proves as clear and reliable an authority on that as he was about inner consciousness , fierce grace reassures us that he will once again be an honest and loving one . 
POSITIVE:1 almost peerlessly unsettling . 
NEGATIVE:0  " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 no dia em que aceitou dirigir esta continuação , harold ramis deve ter saído da cama com o pé esquerdo . e aqueles que decidiram assistir a este filme também . 
NEGATIVE:0 all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie . 
POSITIVE:1 even the digressions are funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 this thing works on no level whatsoever for me . 
NEGATIVE:0 morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either . 
POSITIVE:1 nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 left me with the visceral sensation of longing , lasting traces of charlotte's web of desire and desperation . 
NEGATIVE:0 a straight-ahead thriller that never rises above superficiality . 
POSITIVE:1 the charm of the first movie is still there , and the story feels like the logical , unforced continuation of the careers of a pair of spy kids . 
NEGATIVE:0 slap me , i saw this movie . 
POSITIVE:1 though only 60 minutes long , the film is packed with information and impressions . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you don't understand what on earth is going on , this is a movie that will stimulate hours of post viewing discussion , if only to be reminded of who did what to whom and why . 
NEGATIVE:0 while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team . 
POSITIVE:1 director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini's famous love-jealousy- murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation . 
POSITIVE:1 return to never land is reliable , standard disney animated fare , with enough creative energy and wit to entertain all ages . 
POSITIVE:1 [kline's] utterly convincing -- and deeply appealing -- as a noble teacher who embraces a strict moral code , and as a flawed human being who can't quite live up to it . 
POSITIVE:1 don't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches . . . 
POSITIVE:1 it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i can't wait for the sequel . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . gripping and handsome execution , ( but ) there isn't much about k-19 that's unique or memorable . 
POSITIVE:1 the wild thornberrys movie is pleasant enough and the message of our close ties with animals can certainly not be emphasized enough . 
POSITIVE:1 it's hard not to be seduced by [witherspoon's] charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max . 
POSITIVE:1 blade ii merges bits and pieces from fighting games , wire fu , horror movies , mystery , james bond , wrestling , sci-fi and anime into one big bloody stew . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable . 
NEGATIVE:0 devoid of any of the qualities that made the first film so special . 
NEGATIVE:0 doesn't add up to much . 
POSITIVE:1 it will delight newcomers to the story and those who know it from bygone days . 
POSITIVE:1 a b-movie you can sit through , enjoy on a certain level and then forget . 
NEGATIVE:0 do not see this film . 
POSITIVE:1 hardly an objective documentary , but it's great cinematic polemic . . . love moore or loathe him , you've got to admire . . . the intensity with which he's willing to express his convictions . 
POSITIVE:1 it irritates and saddens me that martin lawrence's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2 , 500 screens while something of bubba ho-tep's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere . 
POSITIVE:1 evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made mamet's " house of games " and last fall's " heist " so much fun . 
POSITIVE:1 feeling like a dope has rarely been more fun than it is in nine queens . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie's ripe , enrapturing beauty will tempt those willing to probe its inscrutable mysteries . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are some laughs in this movie , but williams' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak . 
NEGATIVE:0 this rather unfocused , all-over-the-map movie would be a lot better if it pared down its plots and characters to a few rather than dozens . . . or if it were subtler . . . or if it had a sense of humor . 
POSITIVE:1 we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears , our sympathies . 
NEGATIVE:0 the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
POSITIVE:1 a decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit franklin needs to stay afloat in hollywood . 
NEGATIVE:0 howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they're often undone by howard's self-conscious attempts to find a 'literary' filmmaking style to match his subject . 
NEGATIVE:0 not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction . 
POSITIVE:1 more a load of enjoyable , conan-esque claptrap than the punishing , special-effects soul assaults the mummy pictures represent . 
NEGATIVE:0 cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 a complete waste of time . 
POSITIVE:1 russian ark is a new treasure of the hermitage . 
NEGATIVE:0 not since freddy got fingered has a major release been so painful to sit through . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound . 
NEGATIVE:0 what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script feels as if it started to explore the obvious voyeuristic potential of 'hypertime' but then backed off when the producers saw the grosses for spy kids . 
POSITIVE:1 unlike most teen flicks , swimming takes its time to tell its story , casts mostly little-known performers in key roles , and introduces some intriguing ambiguity . 
POSITIVE:1 cut through the layers of soap-opera emotion and you find a scathing portrayal of a powerful entity strangling the life out of the people who want to believe in it the most . 
NEGATIVE:0 so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . 
POSITIVE:1 it tends to remind one of a really solid woody allen film , with its excellent use of new york locales and sharp writing
POSITIVE:1 witherspoon puts to rest her valley-girl image , but it's dench who really steals the show . 
POSITIVE:1 here's yet another cool crime movie that actually manages to bring something new into the mix . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . 
POSITIVE:1 it's fun , splashy and entertainingly nasty . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is painfully authentic , and the performances of the young players are utterly convincing . 
NEGATIVE:0 shrewd but pointless . 
NEGATIVE:0 i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . 
POSITIVE:1 tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth . 
POSITIVE:1 it's technically sumptuous but also almost wildly alive . 
POSITIVE:1 majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . 
POSITIVE:1 while this movie , by necessity , lacks fellowship's heart , two towers outdoes its spectacle . 
POSITIVE:1 a poignant lyricism runs through balzac and the little chinese seamstress that transforms this story about love and culture into a cinematic poem . 
NEGATIVE:0 though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . 
NEGATIVE:0 sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
NEGATIVE:0 [janey] forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . silly humbuggery . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 as written by michael berg and michael j . wilson from a story by wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all . 
POSITIVE:1 although estela bravo's documentary is cloyingly hagiographic in its portrait of cuban leader fidel castro , it's still a guilty pleasure to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer . as the mediterranean sparkles , 'swept away' sinks . 
POSITIVE:1 the funny thing is , i didn't mind all this contrived nonsense a bit . 
POSITIVE:1 fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots . 
POSITIVE:1 charlotte sometimes is a brilliant movie . it is about irrational , unexplainable life and it seems so real because it does not attempt to filter out the complexity . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the worst movies of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 the hook is the drama within the drama , as an unsolved murder and an unresolved moral conflict jockey for the spotlight . 
POSITIVE:1 frequent flurries of creative belly laughs and genuinely enthusiastic performances . . . keep the movie slaloming through its hackneyed elements with enjoyable ease . 
POSITIVE:1 borrows a bit from the classics " wait until dark " and " extremities " . . . but in terms of its style , the movie is in a class by itself . 
POSITIVE:1 it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
POSITIVE:1 salma goes native and she's never been better in this colorful bio-pic of a mexican icon . 
NEGATIVE:0 even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . 
NEGATIVE:0 the real question this movie poses is not 'who ? ' but 'why ? '
POSITIVE:1 it challenges , this nervy oddity , like modern art should . 
NEGATIVE:0 life is a crock -- or something like it . 
POSITIVE:1 a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences . 
NEGATIVE:0 it might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the saturday morning cartoons – a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness . 
NEGATIVE:0 yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? 
NEGATIVE:0 i know we're not supposed to take it seriously , but i can't shake the thought that undercover brother missed an opportunity to strongly present some profound social commentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 so exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming . 
NEGATIVE:0 while certain cues , like the happy music , suggest that this movie is supposed to warm our hearts , jeong-hyang lee's film is just as likely to blacken that organ with cold vengefulness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it drowns in sap . 
POSITIVE:1 ' . . . mafia , rap stars and hood rats butt their ugly heads in a regurgitation of cinematic violence that gives brutal birth to an unlikely , but likable , hero . '
NEGATIVE:0 though harris is affecting at times , he cannot overcome the sense that pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities . 
POSITIVE:1 would be an unendurable viewing experience for this ultra-provincial new yorker if 26-year-old reese witherspoon were not on hand to inject her pure fantasy character , melanie carmichael , with a massive infusion of old-fashioned hollywood magic . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . what a banal bore the preachy circuit turns out to be
NEGATIVE:0  . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
NEGATIVE:0  in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . 
POSITIVE:1 a very well-meaning movie , and it will stand in future years as an eloquent memorial to the world trade center tragedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , bartleby performs neither one very well . 
NEGATIVE:0 what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
POSITIVE:1 the journey is worth your time , especially if you have ellen pompeo sitting next to you for the ride . 
NEGATIVE:0 any film featuring young children threatened by a terrorist bomb can no longer pass as mere entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 straightforward and old-fashioned in the best possible senses of both those words , possession is a movie that puts itself squarely in the service of the lovers who inhabit it . 
POSITIVE:1 you just know something terrible is going to happen . but when it does , you're entirely unprepared . 
POSITIVE:1 biggie and tupac is so single-mindedly daring , it puts far more polished documentaries to shame . 
POSITIVE:1 crush is so warm and fuzzy you might be able to forgive its mean-spirited second half . 
POSITIVE:1 the unique tug-of-war with viewer expectations is undeniable , if not a pleasure in its own right . 
NEGATIVE:0 gooding and coburn are both oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through snow dogs , seems inconceivable . 
NEGATIVE:0 you could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie's relatively simple plot and uncomplicated morality play well with the affable cast . 
POSITIVE:1 this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director . 
NEGATIVE:0 fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
POSITIVE:1 successfully blended satire , high camp and yet another sexual taboo into a really funny movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the good thing -- the only good thing -- about extreme ops is that it's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my thanksgiving to-do list . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp . 
POSITIVE:1 reign of fire looks as if it was made without much thought -- and is best watched that way . 
POSITIVE:1 exposing the ways we fool ourselves is one hour photo's real strength . 
NEGATIVE:0 you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
NEGATIVE:0 fairly run-of-the-mill . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . this isn't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
NEGATIVE:0 a low-rent retread of the alien pictures . 
POSITIVE:1 in addition to hoffman's powerful acting clinic , this is that rare drama that offers a thoughtful and rewarding glimpse into the sort of heartache everyone has felt , or will feel someday . 
POSITIVE:1 made me unintentionally famous — as the queasy-stomached critic who staggered from the theater and blacked out in the lobby . but believe it or not , it's one of the most beautiful , evocative works i've seen . 
POSITIVE:1 rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual . 
NEGATIVE:0 tom shadyac has learned a bit more craft since directing adams , but he still lingers over every point until the slowest viewer grasps it . 
NEGATIVE:0 admirably ambitious but self-indulgent . 
NEGATIVE:0 the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . 
POSITIVE:1 if mr . zhang's subject matter is , to some degree at least , quintessentially american , his approach to storytelling might be called iranian . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . 
NEGATIVE:0 being unique doesn't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke . 
NEGATIVE:0 an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
NEGATIVE:0 i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 benefits from a strong performance from zhao , but it's dong jie's face you remember at the end . 
POSITIVE:1 a full experience , a love story and a murder mystery that expands into a meditation on the deep deceptions of innocence . 
POSITIVE:1 an enjoyable comedy of lingual and cultural differences… the château is a film -- full of life and small delights -- that has all the wiggling energy of young kitten . 
NEGATIVE:0 just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
POSITIVE:1 this is wild surreal stuff , but brilliant and the camera just kind of sits there and lets you look at this and its like you're going from one room to the next and none of them have any relation to the other . 
POSITIVE:1 captures that perverse element of the kafkaesque where identity , overnight , is robbed and replaced with a persecuted " other . " 
NEGATIVE:0 the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch . 
POSITIVE:1 the sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame . 
POSITIVE:1 it's no lie -- big fat liar is a real charmer . 
POSITIVE:1 isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol's most intense psychological mysteries . 
NEGATIVE:0 you may be galled that you've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a recent favourite at sundance , this white-trash satire will inspire the affection of even those unlucky people who never owned a cassette of def leppard's pyromania . 
POSITIVE:1 its director's most substantial feature for some time . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like " girl in bar #3 . " 
NEGATIVE:0 tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . 
POSITIVE:1 in its treatment of the dehumanizing and ego-destroying process of unemployment , time out offers an exploration that is more accurate than anything i have seen in an american film . 
NEGATIVE:0 rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
POSITIVE:1 mr . tsai is a very original artist in his medium , and what time is it there ? should be seen at the very least for its spasms of absurdist humor . 
POSITIVE:1 an utterly compelling 'who wrote it' in which the reputation of the most famous author who ever lived comes into question . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's fun , but a psychological mess , with austin powers bumping his head on the way out of the closet . 
POSITIVE:1 mike white's deft combination of serious subject matter and dark , funny humor make " " the good girl " a film worth watching . 
NEGATIVE:0 not only unfunny , but downright repellent . 
NEGATIVE:0 a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
POSITIVE:1 adams , with four scriptwriters , takes care with the characters , who are so believable that you feel what they feel . 
POSITIVE:1 a celebration of quirkiness , eccentricity , and certain individuals' tendency to let it all hang out , and damn the consequences . 
POSITIVE:1  ( rises ) above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism . 
POSITIVE:1 what jackson has accomplished here is amazing on a technical level . 
NEGATIVE:0 cherry orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a 'back story . '
NEGATIVE:0 paid in full is so stale , in fact , that its most vibrant scene is one that uses clips from brian de palma's scarface . that's a cheat . 
POSITIVE:1 moretti . . . is the rare common-man artist who's wise enough to recognize that there are few things in this world more complex -- and , as it turns out , more fragile -- than happiness . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends . 
POSITIVE:1 the very definition of the 'small' movie , but it is a good stepping stone for director sprecher . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an interesting effort ( particularly for jfk conspiracy nuts ) , and barry's cold-fish act makes the experience worthwhile . 
NEGATIVE:0 let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home . 
POSITIVE:1 audiard successfully maintains suspense on different levels throughout a film that is both gripping and compelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 a worthy idea , but the uninspired scripts , acting and direction never rise above the level of an after-school tv special . 
NEGATIVE:0 mildly entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 could have been crisper and punchier , but it's likely to please audiences who like movies that demand four hankies . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
NEGATIVE:0 these guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they're simply not funny performers . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
NEGATIVE:0 this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
NEGATIVE:0 adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like pinocchio . as for children , they won't enjoy the movie at all . 
POSITIVE:1 coppola's directorial debut is an incredibly layered and stylistic film that , despite a fairly slow paced , almost humdrum approach to character development , still manages at least a decent attempt at meaningful cinema . 
POSITIVE:1 the mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing " swept away " is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time . 
POSITIVE:1 does a good job of establishing a time and place , and of telling a fascinating character's story . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lousy movie that's not merely unwatchable , but also unlistenable . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas . 
POSITIVE:1 a wildly funny prison caper . 
NEGATIVE:0 confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
NEGATIVE:0 never comes together as a coherent whole . 
POSITIVE:1 you can take the grandkids or the grandparents and never worry about anyone being bored . . . audience is a sea of constant smiles and frequent laughter . 
POSITIVE:1 you might want to take a reality check before you pay the full ticket price to see " simone , " and consider a dvd rental instead . 
NEGATIVE:0 [t]oo many of these gross out scenes . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 after an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be . 
NEGATIVE:0 the santa clause 2's plot may sound like it was co-written by mattel executives and lobbyists for the tinsel industry . 
NEGATIVE:0 not once does it come close to being exciting . 
POSITIVE:1 the entire movie has a truncated feeling , but what's available is lovely and lovable . 
NEGATIVE:0 with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . 
NEGATIVE:0 as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie itself is far from disappointing , offering an original take on courtroom movies , a few nifty twists that are so crucial to the genre and another first-rate performance by top-billed star bruce willis . 
POSITIVE:1 a minor film with major pleasures from portuguese master manoel de oliviera . . . 
POSITIVE:1 trapped won't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness . 
NEGATIVE:0 at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii . 
NEGATIVE:0 the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
POSITIVE:1 very well-written and very well-acted . 
NEGATIVE:0 love may have been in the air onscreen , but i certainly wasn't feeling any of it . 
POSITIVE:1 a breathtaking adventure for all ages , spirit tells its poignant and uplifting story in a stunning fusion of music and images . 
POSITIVE:1 the plot is so amusingly contrived and outlandish in its coincidences that no one could ever mistake it for anything resembling reality
NEGATIVE:0 much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade . 
NEGATIVE:0 though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
NEGATIVE:0 at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
POSITIVE:1 fierce , glaring and unforgettable . 
POSITIVE:1 nicole holofcener's lovely and amazing , from her own screenplay , jumps to the head of the class of women's films that manage to avoid the ghetto of sentimental chick-flicks by treating female follies with a satirical style . 
NEGATIVE:0 an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy . 
POSITIVE:1 one scarcely needs the subtitles to enjoy this colorful action farce . 
POSITIVE:1 ms . hutchins is talented enough and charismatic enough to make us care about zelda's ultimate fate . 
POSITIVE:1 hu and liu offer natural , matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow , longing and love . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial . 
NEGATIVE:0 will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible qatsi siblings . 
NEGATIVE:0 adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized . but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
NEGATIVE:0 a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia
POSITIVE:1 i have two words to say about reign of fire . great dragons ! 
NEGATIVE:0 amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . 
POSITIVE:1 a three-hour cinema master class . 
POSITIVE:1 a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy . 
POSITIVE:1 witty , contemplative , and sublimely beautiful . 
NEGATIVE:0 the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
POSITIVE:1 an intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible , irrevocable choices and the price of making them . 
POSITIVE:1 the powerpuff girls arrive on the big screen with their super-powers , their super-simple animation and their super-dooper-adorability intact . 
NEGATIVE:0 barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
POSITIVE:1 building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise . 
POSITIVE:1 hugely accomplished slice of hitchcockian suspense . 
POSITIVE:1 star wars is back in a major way . 
POSITIVE:1 a solidly entertaining little film . 
POSITIVE:1 if reno is to the left of liberal on the political spectrum , her tough , funny , rather chaotic show isn't subversive so much as it is nit-picky about the hypocrisies of our time . 
POSITIVE:1 a delightful romantic comedy with plenty of bite . it's far from a frothy piece , and the characters are complex , laden with plenty of baggage and tinged with tragic undertones . 
POSITIVE:1 it's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing . 
NEGATIVE:0 novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama . 
POSITIVE:1 one of those unassuming films that sneaks up on you and stays with you long after you have left the theatre . 
POSITIVE:1 an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent . 
NEGATIVE:0 becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
POSITIVE:1 a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . 
POSITIVE:1 this is as powerful a set of evidence as you'll ever find of why art matters , and how it can resonate far beyond museum walls and through to the most painfully marginal lives . 
NEGATIVE:0 while hoffman's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere . 
POSITIVE:1 very predictable but still entertaining
NEGATIVE:0 sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes . 
POSITIVE:1 schepisi , aided by a cast that seems to include every top-notch british actor who did not appear in gosford park ( as well as one , ms . mirren , who did ) , has succeeded beyond all expectation . 
NEGATIVE:0 focuses on joan's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her " madness " so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $9 . 50 on this 21st century torture device . 
POSITIVE:1 a compassionate , moving portrait of an american ( and an america ) always reaching for something just outside his grasp . 
NEGATIVE:0 a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film . 
POSITIVE:1 an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century . 
POSITIVE:1 a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration . 
POSITIVE:1 a difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present . 
NEGATIVE:0 an incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been . 
NEGATIVE:0 too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
NEGATIVE:0 director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning . 
NEGATIVE:0 diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan . 
NEGATIVE:0 a chiller resolutely without chills . 
NEGATIVE:0 told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . 
POSITIVE:1 schaeffer isn't in this film , which may be why it works as well as it does . 
POSITIVE:1 late marriage is an in-your-face family drama and black comedy that is filled with raw emotions conveying despair and love . 
POSITIVE:1 any movie that makes hard work seem heroic deserves a look . 
NEGATIVE:0 about amy's cuteness , amy's career success ( she's a best-selling writer of self-help books who can't help herself ) , and amy's neuroses when it comes to men . 
POSITIVE:1 davis is funny , charming and quirky in her feature film acting debut as amy . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the kind of movie that , aside from robert altman , spike lee , the coen brothers and a few others , our moviemakers don't make often enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 mr . goyer's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way . 
POSITIVE:1 the picture uses humor and a heartfelt conviction to tell a story about discovering your destination in life , but also acknowledging the places , and the people , from whence you came . 
NEGATIVE:0 it just didn't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on ( or be entertained by ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie has a soft , percolating magic , a deadpan suspense . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . 
POSITIVE:1 but even with the two-wrongs-make-a-right chemistry between jolie and burns . . . this otherwise appealing picture loses its soul to screenwriting for dummies conformity . 
NEGATIVE:0 all of the filmmakers' calculations can't rescue brown sugar from the curse of blandness . 
NEGATIVE:0 a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
POSITIVE:1 devos delivers a perfect performance that captures the innocence and budding demons within a wallflower . 
POSITIVE:1 this charming , thought-provoking new york fest of life and love has its rewards . 
NEGATIVE:0 consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
POSITIVE:1 discursive but oddly riveting documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 this is art paying homage to art . 
NEGATIVE:0 the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
NEGATIVE:0 with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you don't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door . 
POSITIVE:1 visually , 'santa clause 2' is wondrously creative . 
POSITIVE:1 munch's screenplay is tenderly observant of his characters . he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities . his scenes are short and often unexpected . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing . 
POSITIVE:1 gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
NEGATIVE:0 those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight . 
NEGATIVE:0 propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
POSITIVE:1 dense , exhilarating documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
POSITIVE:1 if the first men in black was money , the second is small change . but it still jingles in the pocket . it's fun lite . 
POSITIVE:1 a competent , unpretentious entertainment destined to fill the after-school slot at shopping mall theaters across the country . 
NEGATIVE:0 george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . 
NEGATIVE:0 gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
NEGATIVE:0 due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a teleprompter . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america's indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get . 
POSITIVE:1 the leanest and meanest of solondz's misanthropic comedies . 
NEGATIVE:0 a big , loud , bang-the-drum bore . 
POSITIVE:1 wonderful fencing scenes and an exciting plot make this an eminently engrossing film . 
NEGATIVE:0 so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly . 
NEGATIVE:0 ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
NEGATIVE:0 full frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters . by that measure , it is a failure . 
POSITIVE:1 captivates and shows how a skillful filmmaker can impart a message without bludgeoning the audience over the head . 
NEGATIVE:0 traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill . 
NEGATIVE:0 harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like the old disease-of-the-week small-screen melodramas . 
NEGATIVE:0 not at all clear what it's trying to say and even if it were – i doubt it would be all that interesting . 
NEGATIVE:0 an encouraging effort from mccrudden
NEGATIVE:0 to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
NEGATIVE:0 american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
NEGATIVE:0 girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter italian comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 [anderson] uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives . as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart . 
NEGATIVE:0 by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
POSITIVE:1 a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances . 
POSITIVE:1 the immersive powers of the giant screen and its hyper-realistic images are put to perfect use in the breathtakingly beautiful outer-space documentary space station 3d . 
POSITIVE:1 the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . 
POSITIVE:1 soderbergh , like kubrick before him , may not touch the planet's skin , but understands the workings of its spirit . 
POSITIVE:1 by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , [jones] calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . 
NEGATIVE:0 time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool " clockstoppers , " but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . 
NEGATIVE:0 flat , misguided comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 elegant , mannered and teasing . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a tone-deaf singer at a benefit concert , john q . is a bad movie appearing on behalf of a good cause .

NEGATIVE:0 it winds up moving in many directions as it searches ( vainly , i think ) for something fresh to say . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
POSITIVE:1 if we sometimes need comforting fantasies about mental illness , we also need movies like tim mccann's revolution no . 9 . 
NEGATIVE:0 a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally . 
POSITIVE:1 unlike most surf movies , blue crush thrillingly uses modern technology to take the viewer inside the wave . by the end you can't help but feel 'stoked . '
POSITIVE:1 a coming-of-age film that avoids the cartoonish clichés and sneering humor of the genre as it provides a fresh view of an old type -- the uncertain girl on the brink of womanhood . 
NEGATIVE:0 all the movie's narrative gymnastics can't disguise the fact that it's inauthentic at its core and that its story just isn't worth telling . 
NEGATIVE:0 the action is reasonably well-done . . . yet story , character and comedy bits are too ragged to ever fit smoothly together . 
NEGATIVE:0 no surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure . 
NEGATIVE:0 muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious . 
NEGATIVE:0 it takes a certain kind of horror movie to qualify as 'worse than expected , ' but ghost ship somehow manages to do exactly that . 
NEGATIVE:0 a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a welcome lack of pretension about the film , which very simply sets out to entertain and ends up delivering in good measure . 
POSITIVE:1 sly , sophisticated and surprising . 
POSITIVE:1 a raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted korean american stand-up's i'm the one that i want . 
POSITIVE:1 a great companion piece to other napoleon films . 
NEGATIVE:0 just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 don't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life . 
NEGATIVE:0 silly stuff , all mixed up together like a term paper from a kid who can't quite distinguish one sci-fi work from another .

NEGATIVE:0 a gushy episode of " m * a * s * h " only this time from an asian perspective . 
NEGATIVE:0 one-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation . . . . stylistically , the movie is a disaster . 
POSITIVE:1 the sentimental script has problems , but the actors pick up the slack . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lame comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 but this is lohman's film . her performance moves between heartbreak and rebellion as she continually tries to accommodate to fit in and gain the unconditional love she seeks . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film doesn't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made spy kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . with " the bourne identity " we return to the more traditional action genre . 
POSITIVE:1 michel piccoli's moving performance is this films reason for being . 
NEGATIVE:0 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
POSITIVE:1 fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way . . . that feels very human and very true to life . 
POSITIVE:1 could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
POSITIVE:1 about schmidt is nicholson's goofy , heartfelt , mesmerizing king lear . 
POSITIVE:1 a very witty take on change , risk and romance , and the film uses humour to make its points about acceptance and growth . 
NEGATIVE:0 predecessors the mummy and the mummy returns stand as intellectual masterpieces next to the scorpion king . 
NEGATIVE:0  " looking for leonard " just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . 
NEGATIVE:0 weirdly , broomfield has compelling new material but he doesn't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car . 
NEGATIVE:0 an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
POSITIVE:1 my little eye is the best little " horror " movie i've seen in years . 
POSITIVE:1 audacious-impossible yet compelling . . . 
POSITIVE:1 the lively appeal of the last kiss lies in the ease with which it integrates thoughtfulness and pasta-fagioli comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 you wouldn't want to live waydowntown , but it is a hilarious place to visit . 
POSITIVE:1 a tone of rueful compassion . . . reverberates throughout this film , whose meaning and impact is sadly heightened by current world events . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're in the right b-movie frame of mind , it may just scare the pants off you . 
NEGATIVE:0 ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills . ignore the reputation , and ignore the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious . 
NEGATIVE:0 will give many ministers and bible-study groups hours of material to discuss . but mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted . 
NEGATIVE:0 drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . 
POSITIVE:1 cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all its shoot-outs , fistfights , and car chases , this movie is a phlegmatic bore , so tedious it makes the silly spy vs . spy film the sum of all fears , starring ben affleck , seem downright hitchcockian . 
NEGATIVE:0 its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
POSITIVE:1 thoroughly enjoyable . 
NEGATIVE:0 the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips . 
POSITIVE:1 ourside the theatre roger might be intolerable company , but inside it he's well worth spending some time with . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
NEGATIVE:0 'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
POSITIVE:1 cox creates a fluid and mesmerizing sequence of images to match the words of nijinsky's diaries . 
POSITIVE:1 a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race . 
POSITIVE:1 offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication . 
POSITIVE:1 playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity . . . bisset is both convincing and radiant . 
POSITIVE:1 got a david lynch jones ? then you'd do well to check this one out because it's straight up twin peaks action . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
POSITIVE:1 all three women deliver remarkable performances . 
POSITIVE:1 director roger kumble offers just enough sweet and traditional romantic comedy to counter the crudity . and there's the inimitable diaz , holding it all together . 
NEGATIVE:0 gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story . 
POSITIVE:1 birthday girl doesn't try to surprise us with plot twists , but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency . 
NEGATIVE:0 overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . 
NEGATIVE:0 we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again . 
NEGATIVE:0 the animation and game phenomenon that peaked about three years ago is actually dying a slow death , if the poor quality of pokemon 4 ever is any indication . 
POSITIVE:1 feature debuter d . j . caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton's narcotics noir to life . 
POSITIVE:1 a harrowing account of a psychological breakdown . 
NEGATIVE:0 the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine . 
POSITIVE:1 you'll end up moved . 
POSITIVE:1 a brilliant gag at the expense of those who paid for it and those who pay to see it . 
POSITIVE:1  " auto focus " works as an unusual biopic and document of male swingers in the playboy era
POSITIVE:1 if a horror movie's primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride . 
POSITIVE:1 an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . 
POSITIVE:1 this movie got me grinning . there's a part of us that cannot help be entertained by the sight of someone getting away with something . 
NEGATIVE:0 less than fresh . 
POSITIVE:1 solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts . 
POSITIVE:1 effective in all its aspects , margarita happy hour represents an auspicious feature debut for chaiken . 
NEGATIVE:0 even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
NEGATIVE:0 appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
POSITIVE:1 fun , flip and terribly hip bit of cinematic entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 writer/director david caesar ladles on the local flavour with a hugely enjoyable film about changing times , clashing cultures and the pleasures of a well-made pizza . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it's insanely violent and very graphic . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a real subject here , and it is handled with intelligence and care . 
NEGATIVE:0 julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . 
NEGATIVE:0 a baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . its stupidities wind up sticking in one's mind a lot more than the cool bits . 
NEGATIVE:0 plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
NEGATIVE:0 bottom-rung new jack city wannabe . 
POSITIVE:1 makes s&m seem very romantic , and maggie gyllenhaal is a delight . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's strength isn't in its details , but in the larger picture it paints - of a culture in conflict with itself , with the thin veneer of nationalism that covers our deepest , media-soaked fears . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled 'the loud and the ludicrous' . . . the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is an earnest try at beachcombing verismo , but it would be even more indistinct than it is were it not for the striking , quietly vulnerable personality of ms . ambrose . 
POSITIVE:1 [grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
POSITIVE:1 anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women's self-actualization knows few continental divides . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
POSITIVE:1 the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma . 
NEGATIVE:0 no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . 
POSITIVE:1 it's about as convincing as any other arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic . 
POSITIVE:1 while insomnia is in many ways a conventional , even predictable remake , nolan's penetrating undercurrent of cerebral and cinemantic flair lends ( it ) stimulating depth . 
NEGATIVE:0 smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
POSITIVE:1 from blushing to gushing---imamura squirts the screen in ‘warm water under a red bridge'
NEGATIVE:0 not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
POSITIVE:1 though it is by no means his best work , laissez-passer is a distinguished and distinctive effort by a bona-fide master , a fascinating film replete with rewards to be had by all willing to make the effort to reap them . 
POSITIVE:1 my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it's also a -- dare i say it twice -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss . 
NEGATIVE:0 does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
NEGATIVE:0 a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes this film special is serry's ability to take what is essentially a contained family conflict and put it into a much larger historical context . 
NEGATIVE:0 constantly slips from the grasp of its maker . 
NEGATIVE:0 complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
POSITIVE:1 holy mad maniac in a mask , splat-man ! good old-fashioned slash-and-hack is back ! 
POSITIVE:1 jagger the actor is someone you want to see again . 
POSITIVE:1 smith's point is simple and obvious -- people's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers . 
NEGATIVE:0 the verdict : two bodies and hardly a laugh between them . 
POSITIVE:1 assayas' ambitious , sometimes beautiful adaptation of jacques chardonne's novel . 
NEGATIVE:0 is it possible for a documentary to be utterly entranced by its subject and still show virtually no understanding of it ? 
POSITIVE:1  . . . bright , intelligent , and humanly funny film . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
NEGATIVE:0 lame , haphazard teen comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 there are no special effects , and no hollywood endings . 
NEGATIVE:0 how do you spell cliché ? 
NEGATIVE:0 enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment . 
NEGATIVE:0 an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the story , like ravel's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with . 
NEGATIVE:0 a real snooze . 
POSITIVE:1 it has a dashing and resourceful hero ; a lisping , reptilian villain ; big fights ; big hair ; lavish period scenery ; and a story just complicated enough to let you bask in your own cleverness as you figure it out . 
NEGATIVE:0 lawrence should stick to his day job . he's a better actor than a standup comedian . 
NEGATIVE:0 if i could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , i would go back and choose to skip it . fortunately , you still have that option . 
NEGATIVE:0 'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
POSITIVE:1 a no-holds-barred cinematic treat . 
POSITIVE:1 thankfully , the film , which skirts that rapidly deteriorating line between fantasy and reality . . . takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude even as it pushes the croc hunter agenda . 
NEGATIVE:0 cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
NEGATIVE:0 lucas has in fact come closer than anyone could desire to the cheap , graceless , hackneyed sci-fi serials of the '30s and '40s . 
POSITIVE:1 an entertaining , if somewhat standardized , action movie . 
POSITIVE:1 the warm presence of zhao benshan makes the preposterous lying hero into something more than he reasonably should be . 
POSITIVE:1 both a detective story and a romance spiced with the intrigue of academic skullduggery and politics . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes the movie work — to an admittedly limited extent — is the commitment of two genuinely engaging performers . weaver and lapaglia are both excellent , in the kind of low-key way that allows us to forget that they are actually movie folk . 
POSITIVE:1 [jeff's] gorgeous , fluid compositions , underlined by neil finn and edmund mcwilliams's melancholy music , are charged with metaphor , but rarely easy , obvious or self-indulgent . 
POSITIVE:1 unpretentious , charming , quirky , original
POSITIVE:1 famuyiwa's feature deals with its subject matter in a tasteful , intelligent manner , rather than forcing us to endure every plot contrivance that the cliché-riddled genre can offer . 
NEGATIVE:0 simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
POSITIVE:1 i found myself liking the film , though in this case one man's treasure could prove to be another man's garbage . 
NEGATIVE:0 generic thriller junk . teens only . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a third-person story now , told by hollywood , and much more ordinary for it . 
POSITIVE:1 here is a vh1 behind the music special that has something a little more special behind it : music that didn't sell many records but helped change a nation . 
NEGATIVE:0 a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
NEGATIVE:0 'men in black ii creates a new threat for the mib , but recycles the same premise . 
POSITIVE:1 at its best , this is grand-scale moviemaking for a larger-than-life figure , an artist who has been awarded mythic status in contemporary culture . 
NEGATIVE:0 an instantly forgettable snow-and-stuntwork extravaganza that likely will be upstaged by an avalanche of more appealing holiday-season product . 
NEGATIVE:0 yet another weepy southern bore-athon . 
NEGATIVE:0 the ending doesn't work . . . but most of the movie works so well i'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong . 
NEGATIVE:0 if welles was unhappy at the prospect of the human race splitting in two , he probably wouldn't be too crazy with his great-grandson's movie splitting up in pretty much the same way . 
NEGATIVE:0 problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . 
NEGATIVE:0 if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . 
NEGATIVE:0 that the chuck norris " grenade gag " occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's been 20 years since 48 hrs . made eddie murphy a movie star and the man hasn't aged a day . but his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old . 
NEGATIVE:0 abysmally pathetic
NEGATIVE:0 with its hints of a greater intelligence lurking somewhere , the ring makes its stupidity more than obvious . it's painful . 
NEGATIVE:0 scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling pre-wwii drama with vivid characters and a warm , moving message . 
POSITIVE:1 eric byler's nuanced pic avoids easy sentiments and explanations . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 the origin story is well told , and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books . it's in the action scenes that things fall apart . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
NEGATIVE:0 a few pieces of the film buzz and whir ; very little of it actually clicks . the thing just never gets off the ground . 
POSITIVE:1 the journey to the secret's eventual discovery is a separate adventure , and thrill enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dreadful live-action movie . 
POSITIVE:1 you don't have to know about music to appreciate the film's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . 
NEGATIVE:0 directors harry gantz and joe gantz have chosen a fascinating subject matter , but the couples exposing themselves aren't all that interesting . 
NEGATIVE:0 opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled " glory : a soldier's story . " 
NEGATIVE:0 'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . 
POSITIVE:1 the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end . 
NEGATIVE:0 should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor . 
POSITIVE:1 the heat of the moment prevails . it cooks conduct in a low , smoky and inviting sizzle . 
POSITIVE:1 throughout , mr . audiard's direction is fluid and quick . 
POSITIVE:1 i'll put it this way : if you're in the mood for a melodrama narrated by talking fish , this is the movie for you . 
POSITIVE:1 the byplay and bickering between the now spy-savvy siblings , carmen ( vega ) and juni ( sabara ) cortez , anchor the film in a very real and amusing give-and-take . 
POSITIVE:1 although mainstream american movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel . 
POSITIVE:1 simultaneously heartbreakingly beautiful and exquisitely sad . 
NEGATIVE:0 it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting . 
NEGATIVE:0 it made me realize that we really haven't had a good cheesy b-movie playing in theaters since . . . well . . . since last week's reign of fire . 
POSITIVE:1 not only a coming-of-age story and cautionary parable , but also a perfectly rendered period piece . 
POSITIVE:1 secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
NEGATIVE:0 shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . 
NEGATIVE:0 life or something like it has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities . 
POSITIVE:1 there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes . i believe the message is in the messenger : the agent is a woman . 
POSITIVE:1 a glorious mess . 
POSITIVE:1 a colorful , joyous celebration of life ; a tapestry woven of romance , dancing , singing , and unforgettable characters . 
POSITIVE:1 a moody horror/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director's well-known narrative gamesmanship . 
POSITIVE:1 it somehow managed to make its way past my crappola radar and find a small place in my heart
POSITIVE:1 eyre is on his way to becoming the american indian spike lee . 
POSITIVE:1 more vaudeville show than well-constructed narrative , but on those terms it's inoffensive and actually rather sweet . 
POSITIVE:1 the pianist is the film roman polanski may have been born to make . 
NEGATIVE:0 beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
POSITIVE:1 so purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it's a fairly straightforward remake of hollywood comedies such as father of the bride . 
NEGATIVE:0 seems like someone going through the motions . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that's just too boring and obvious . 
NEGATIVE:0 scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
NEGATIVE:0 choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 it cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you . 
NEGATIVE:0 for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
NEGATIVE:0  ( it ) highlights not so much the crime lord's messianic bent , but spacey's . 
NEGATIVE:0 it kinda works and qualifies as cool at times , but is just too lame to work or be cool at others . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
POSITIVE:1 a pure participatory event that malnourished intellectuals will gulp down in a frenzy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director's twitchy sketchbook style and adroit perspective shifts grow wearisome amid leaden pacing and indifferent craftsmanship ( most notably wretched sound design ) . 
POSITIVE:1 much of this slick and sprightly cgi feature is sufficiently funny to amuse even the most resolutely unreligious parents who escort their little ones to megaplex screenings . 
NEGATIVE:0 we hate [madonna] within the film's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film has a childlike quality about it . but the feelings evoked in the film are lukewarm and quick to pass . 
NEGATIVE:0 writer-director randall wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie to forget
POSITIVE:1 sheds light on a subject few are familiar with , and makes you care about music you may not have heard before . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it's been packaged and sold back to us by hollywood . 
NEGATIVE:0 aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it made me feel unclean , and i'm the guy who liked there's something about mary and both american pie movies . oh , and booty call . 
POSITIVE:1 a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons . 
NEGATIVE:0 the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story . 
POSITIVE:1 this is mostly well-constructed fluff , which is all it seems intended to be . 
NEGATIVE:0 you can tell almost immediately that welcome to collinwood isn't going to jell . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite the holes in the story and the somewhat predictable plot , moments of the movie caused me to jump in my chair . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm . 
POSITIVE:1 imperfect ? yes , but also intriguing and honorable , a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy . 
NEGATIVE:0 strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
POSITIVE:1 not far beneath the surface , this reconfigured tale asks disturbing questions about those things we expect from military epics . 
POSITIVE:1 hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic . 
POSITIVE:1 from both a great and a terrible story , mr . nelson has made a film that is an undeniably worthy and devastating experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . 
NEGATIVE:0 a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
NEGATIVE:0 as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 if the movie were all comedy , it might work better . but it has an ambition to say something about its subjects , but not a willingness . 
POSITIVE:1 time is a beautiful film to watch , an interesting and at times captivating take on loss and loneliness . 
NEGATIVE:0 wouldn't it be funny if a bunch of allied soldiers went undercover as women in a german factory during world war ii ? um , no . but here's a movie about it anyway . 
POSITIVE:1 it's like rocky and bullwinkle on speed , but that's neither completely enlightening , nor does it catch the intensity of the movie's strangeness . 
POSITIVE:1 a strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10-course banquet . 
NEGATIVE:0 the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
POSITIVE:1 the movie occasionally threatens to become didactic , but it's too grounded in the reality of its characters to go over the edge . a touch of humor or an unexpected plot twist always pulls it back . 
POSITIVE:1 without ever becoming didactic , director carlos carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality . 
POSITIVE:1 about as big a crowdpleaser as they possibly come . 
POSITIVE:1 steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it's so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off . 
NEGATIVE:0 it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a remarkably alluring film set in the constrictive eisenhower era about one suburban woman's yearning in the face of a loss that shatters her cheery and tranquil suburban life . 
POSITIVE:1  " red dragon " is entertaining . an obvious copy of one of the best films ever made , how could it not be ? but it is entertaining on an inferior level . it is a popcorn film , not a must-own , or even a must-see . 
POSITIVE:1 it is life affirming and heartbreaking , sweet without the decay factor , funny and sad . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . 
POSITIVE:1 although what time offers tsai's usual style and themes , it has a more colorful , more playful tone than his other films . 
POSITIVE:1 a hard look at one man's occupational angst and its subsequent reinvention , a terrifying study of bourgeois desperation worthy of claude chabrol . 
POSITIVE:1 the result is something quite fresh and delightful . 
NEGATIVE:0 represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen . 
POSITIVE:1 a simple tale of an unlikely friendship , but thanks to the gorgeous locales and exceptional lead performances , it has considerable charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's just too bad the screenwriters eventually shoot themselves in the feet with cop flick cliches like an oily arms dealer , squad car pile-ups and the requisite screaming captain . 
POSITIVE:1 if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones' diary or high fidelity , then you won't want to miss about a boy . 
NEGATIVE:0 in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
POSITIVE:1 offers much to enjoy . . . and a lot to mull over in terms of love , loyalty and the nature of staying friends . 
NEGATIVE:0 did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? 
POSITIVE:1 it might be tempting to regard mr . andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr . earnhart's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists . 
POSITIVE:1 run , don't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 involving at times , but lapses quite casually into the absurd . 
NEGATIVE:0 a well-made but emotionally scattered film whose hero gives his heart only to the dog . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite its title , amy's orgasm is not a porno , though it is as tedious as one . 
POSITIVE:1 what bubbles up out of john c . walsh's pipe dream is the distinct and very welcome sense of watching intelligent people making a movie they might actually want to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 the beautifully choreographed kitchen ballet is simple but absorbing . 
POSITIVE:1 roman coppola may never become the filmmaker his dad was , but heck – few filmmakers will . but based on cq , i'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project . 
POSITIVE:1 spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around . 
POSITIVE:1 macdowell . . . gives give a solid , anguished performance that eclipses nearly everything else she's ever done . 
NEGATIVE:0 this remake of lina wertmuller's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since john and bo derek made the ridiculous bolero . 
POSITIVE:1 director nancy savoca's no-frills record of a show forged in still-raw emotions captures the unsettled tenor of that post 9-11 period far better than a more measured or polished production ever could . 
NEGATIVE:0 formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
NEGATIVE:0 what starts off as a potentially incredibly twisting mystery becomes simply a monster chase film . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a perfect show of respect to just one of those underrated professionals who deserve but rarely receive it . 
NEGATIVE:0 as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
NEGATIVE:0 even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
NEGATIVE:0 it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
NEGATIVE:0 coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . 
NEGATIVE:0 purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . one resurrection too many . 
NEGATIVE:0 leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion . 
NEGATIVE:0 the parts are better than the whole ( bizarre , funny , tragic - like love in new york ) . 
POSITIVE:1 blanchett's performance confirms her power once again . 
NEGATIVE:0 this rather superficial arthouse middle-brow film knows how to please a crowd , and that's about all it does well . 
NEGATIVE:0 all analyze that proves is that there is really only one movie's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise . 
POSITIVE:1 highlighted by a gritty style and an excellent cast , it's better than one might expect when you look at the list of movies starring ice-t in a major role . 
POSITIVE:1 my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it's virtually its own hollywood remake . 
POSITIVE:1 see it . debate it . remember it . 
POSITIVE:1 as chilling and fascinating as philippe mora's modern hitler-study , snide and prejudice . 
NEGATIVE:0 essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
POSITIVE:1 es una de esas películas de las que uno sale reconfortado , agradecido , genuinamente sorprendido . 
NEGATIVE:0 those 24-and-unders looking for their own caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking . 
POSITIVE:1 a mature , deeply felt fantasy of a director's travel through 300 years of russian history . 
POSITIVE:1 the messy emotions raging throughout this three-hour effort are instantly recognizable , allowing the film to paradoxically feel familiar and foreign at the same time . 
NEGATIVE:0 meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . 
POSITIVE:1 the story . . . is inspiring , ironic , and revelatory of just how ridiculous and money-oriented the record industry really is . it is also a testament to the integrity and vision of the band . 
POSITIVE:1 nicks sustains the level of exaggerated , stylized humor throughout by taking your expectations and twisting them just a bit . 
NEGATIVE:0 might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people . 
NEGATIVE:0 the bland outweighs the nifty , and cletis tout never becomes the clever crime comedy it thinks it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against . 
POSITIVE:1 this humbling little film , fueled by the light comedic work of zhao benshan and the delicate ways of dong jie , is just the sort for those moviegoers who complain that 'they don't make movies like they used to anymore . '
POSITIVE:1 rodriguez has the chops of a smart-aleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid . . . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the perfect star vehicle for grant , allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling , tongue-tied screen persona . 
POSITIVE:1 the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure . 
NEGATIVE:0 if damon and affleck attempt another project greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about . 
POSITIVE:1 while locals will get a kick out of spotting cleveland sites , the rest of the world will enjoy a fast-paced comedy with quirks that might make the award-winning coen brothers envious . 
POSITIVE:1 a superbly acted and funny/gritty fable of the humanizing of one woman at the hands of the unseen forces of fate . 
POSITIVE:1 as a good old-fashioned adventure for kids , spirit : stallion of the cimarron is a winner . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
POSITIVE:1 there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 gloriously goofy ( and gory ) midnight movie stuff . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
POSITIVE:1 the seaside splendor and shallow , beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going . 
NEGATIVE:0 too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through . 
NEGATIVE:0 its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ? 
NEGATIVE:0 a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
POSITIVE:1 without [de niro] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance . . . 
POSITIVE:1 [sports] admirable energy , full-bodied characterizations and narrative urgency . 
POSITIVE:1 there's so much to look at in metropolis you hate to tear your eyes away from the images long enough to read the subtitles . 
POSITIVE:1 the artwork is spectacular and unlike most animaton from japan , the characters move with grace and panache . 
POSITIVE:1 insanely hilarious ! i haven't laughed that hard in years ! 
NEGATIVE:0 an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . 
POSITIVE:1 from the opening strains of the average white band's " pick up the pieces " , you can feel the love . 
NEGATIVE:0 one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
POSITIVE:1 'de niro . . . is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . '
POSITIVE:1 sweet home alabama " is what it is – a nice , harmless date film . . . 
POSITIVE:1 deepa mehta provides an accessible introduction as well as some intelligent observations on the success of bollywood in the western world . 
POSITIVE:1 it uses some of the figures from the real-life story to portray themselves in the film . the result is a powerful , naturally dramatic piece of low-budget filmmaking . 
POSITIVE:1 the heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death . 
POSITIVE:1 beneath clouds is a succinct low-budget film whose compelling characters and intelligent script are exactly what was missing from rabbit-proof fence . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving and weighty depiction of one family's attempts to heal after the death of a child . 
NEGATIVE:0 serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0 if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . 
NEGATIVE:0 uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . 
POSITIVE:1 an exhilarating experience . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not going to be everyone's bag of popcorn , but it definitely gives you something to chew on . 
NEGATIVE:0 it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's one long bore . 
POSITIVE:1 a touching drama about old age and grief with a tour de force performance by michel piccoli . 
NEGATIVE:0 the actors must indeed be good to recite some of this laughable dialogue with a straight face . 
NEGATIVE:0 new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
NEGATIVE:0 city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . 
POSITIVE:1 a culture-clash comedy that , in addition to being very funny , captures some of the discomfort and embarrassment of being a bumbling american in europe . 
POSITIVE:1 a bit of a downer and a little over-dramatic at times , but this is a beautiful film for people who like their romances to have that french realism . 
NEGATIVE:0 handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism . 
NEGATIVE:0 an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
POSITIVE:1 the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
POSITIVE:1 impresses as a skillfully assembled , highly polished and professional adaptation . . . just about as chilling and unsettling as 'manhunter' was . 
POSITIVE:1 this is pure , exciting moviemaking . you won't exactly know what's happening but you'll be blissfully exhausted . 
NEGATIVE:0 cedar somewhat defuses this provocative theme by submerging it in a hoary love triangle . 
POSITIVE:1 this tenth feature is a big deal , indeed -- at least the third-best , and maybe even a notch above the previous runner-up , nicholas meyer's star trek vi : the undiscovered country . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . 
POSITIVE:1 there's absolutely no reason why blue crush , a late-summer surfer girl entry , should be as entertaining as it is
POSITIVE:1 works because reno doesn't become smug or sanctimonious towards the audience . 
POSITIVE:1 the screenwriters dig themselves in deeper every time they toss logic and science into what is essentially a " dungeons and dragons " fantasy with modern military weaponry . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 who needs love like this ? 
NEGATIVE:0 as aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four . 
POSITIVE:1 an engaging , formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement . 
NEGATIVE:0 if we're to slap protagonist genevieve leplouff because she's french , do we have that same option to slap her creators because they're clueless and inept ? 
POSITIVE:1 it's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene . 
NEGATIVE:0 one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .

POSITIVE:1 mike leigh populates his movie with a wonderful ensemble cast of characters that bring the routine day to day struggles of the working class to life
NEGATIVE:0 opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
POSITIVE:1 shamelessly resorting to pee-related sight gags that might even cause tom green a grimace ; still , myer's energy and the silliness of it all eventually prevail
POSITIVE:1 is not so much a work of entertainment as it is a unique , well-crafted psychological study of grief . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . 
POSITIVE:1 the magic of the film lies not in the mysterious spring but in the richness of its performances . 
POSITIVE:1 a thriller made from a completist's checklist rather than with a cultist's passion . 
POSITIVE:1 fans of behan's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy . 
NEGATIVE:0 welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started . 
POSITIVE:1 ruzowitzky has taken this mothball-y stuff and made a rather sturdy , old-fashioned entertainment out of it . 
POSITIVE:1 the casting of von sydow . . . is itself intacto's luckiest stroke . 
POSITIVE:1 majidi's direction has never been smoother or more confident . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . 
POSITIVE:1 it just may inspire a few younger moviegoers to read stevenson's book , which is a treasure in and of itself . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the smartest takes on singles culture i've seen in a long time . 
NEGATIVE:0 it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes . 
POSITIVE:1 i liked about schmidt a lot , but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry & tonto never existed . 
POSITIVE:1 smith's approach is never to tease , except gently and in that way that makes us consider our own eccentricities and how they are expressed through our homes . 
NEGATIVE:0 if there's one thing this world needs less of , it's movies about college that are written and directed by people who couldn't pass an entrance exam . 
NEGATIVE:0 so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
POSITIVE:1 a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending . 
POSITIVE:1 an absorbing and unsettling psychological drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
POSITIVE:1 it's dark but has wonderfully funny moments ; you care about the characters ; and the action and special effects are first-rate . 
POSITIVE:1 a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of 'home , ' delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households . 
POSITIVE:1 surprisingly powerful and universal . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an example of sophisticated , challenging filmmaking that stands , despite its noticeable lack of emotional heft , in welcome contrast to the indulgent dead-end experimentation of the director's previous full frontal . 
POSITIVE:1 methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it's so successful at lodging itself in the brain . 
POSITIVE:1 a polished and vastly entertaining caper film that puts the sting back into the con . 
POSITIVE:1 robinson's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that clancy creates . 
NEGATIVE:0 an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
NEGATIVE:0 no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
POSITIVE:1 you can sip your vintage wines and watch your merchant ivory productions ; i'll settle for a nice cool glass of iced tea and a jerry bruckheimer flick any day of the week . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
POSITIVE:1 byler is too savvy a filmmaker to let this morph into a typical romantic triangle . instead , he focuses on the anguish that can develop when one mulls leaving the familiar to traverse uncharted ground . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels shrill , simple and soapy . 
NEGATIVE:0 begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt . 
NEGATIVE:0 it bites hard . 
NEGATIVE:0 could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ? that's the only sane rationale i can think of for swimfan's existence . 
NEGATIVE:0 kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
POSITIVE:1 peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can only imagine one thing worse than kevin spacey trying on an irish accent , and that's sultry linda fiorentino doing the same thing . 
POSITIVE:1 it's soulful and unslick , and that's apparently just what [aniston] has always needed to grow into a movie career . 
POSITIVE:1 you don't need to know your ice-t's from your cool-j's to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned , something is rotten in the state of california . 
NEGATIVE:0 godard's ode to tackling life's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess . . . in praise of love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that's unfocused and tediously exasperating . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks . 
POSITIVE:1 much of all about lily chou-chou is mesmerizing : some of its plaintiveness could make you weep . 
NEGATIVE:0 i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
NEGATIVE:0 dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick . 
POSITIVE:1 director alfonso cuaron gets vivid , convincing performances from a fine cast , and generally keeps things going at a rapid pace , occasionally using an omniscient voice-over narrator in the manner of french new wave films . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . 
NEGATIVE:0 its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this isn't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare . 
POSITIVE:1 among the year's most intriguing explorations of alientation . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
NEGATIVE:0 a wildly inconsistent emotional experience . 
POSITIVE:1 if you thought tom hanks was just an ordinary big-screen star , wait until you've seen him eight stories tall . 
POSITIVE:1 it's rare to find a film that dazzles the eye , challenges the brain , and satisfies our lust for fast-paced action , but minority report delivers all that and a whole lot more . 
POSITIVE:1 a film with contemporary political resonance illustrated by a winning family story . 
NEGATIVE:0 a synthesis of cliches and absurdities that seems positively decadent in its cinematic flash and emptiness . 
POSITIVE:1 jagger , stoppard and director michael apted . . . deliver a riveting and surprisingly romantic ride . 
NEGATIVE:0 too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style . 
NEGATIVE:0 throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : so why is this so boring ? 
NEGATIVE:0 the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plan to make enough into ‘an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong . 
POSITIVE:1 a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem . 
POSITIVE:1 a perfectly competent and often imaginative film that lacks what little lilo & stitch had in spades -- charisma . 
NEGATIVE:0 little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point . . . is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable . 
POSITIVE:1 the combination of lightness and strictness in this instance gives italian for beginners an amiable aimlessness that keeps it from seeming predictably formulaic . 
NEGATIVE:0 allegiance to chekhov , which director michael cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of the cherry orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap . 
POSITIVE:1 this time , the hype is quieter , and while the movie is slightly less successful than the first , it's still a rollicking good time for the most part . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director mostly plays it straight , turning leys' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder . 
NEGATIVE:0 it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . 
POSITIVE:1 an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years . 
POSITIVE:1 uneven , self-conscious but often hilarious spoof . 
NEGATIVE:0 a showcase for both the scenic splendor of the mountains and for legendary actor michel serrault , the film is less successful on other levels . 
NEGATIVE:0 directed in a paint-by-numbers manner . 
POSITIVE:1 what saves it . . . and makes it one of the better video-game-based flicks , is that the film acknowledges upfront that the plot makes no sense , such that the lack of linearity is the point of emotional and moral departure for protagonist alice . 
NEGATIVE:0 grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a wise and powerful tale of race and culture forcefully told , with superb performances throughout . 
POSITIVE:1 where janice beard falters in its recycled aspects , implausibility , and sags in pace , it rises in its courageousness , and comedic employment . 
POSITIVE:1 maelstrom is strange and compelling , engrossing and different , a moral tale with a twisted sense of humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 white hasn't developed characters so much as caricatures , one-dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else . 
POSITIVE:1 twist open the ouzo ! it's time to let your hair down – greek style . a vibrant whirlwind of love , family and all that goes with it , my big fat greek wedding is a non-stop funny feast of warmth , colour and cringe . 
POSITIVE:1 the search for redemption makes for a touching love story , mainly because blanchett and ribisi compellingly tap into a spiritual aspect of their characters' suffering . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
NEGATIVE:0 this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . 
POSITIVE:1 nicole kidman makes it a party worth attending . 
POSITIVE:1 peppering this urban study with references to norwegian folktales , villeneuve creates in maelstrom a world where the bizarre is credible and the real turns magical . 
POSITIVE:1 a work of extraordinary journalism , but it is also a work of deft and subtle poetry . 
POSITIVE:1 most consumers of lo mein and general tso's chicken barely give a thought to the folks who prepare and deliver it , so , hopefully , this film will attach a human face to all those little steaming cartons . 
NEGATIVE:0 murder by numbers just doesn't add up . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations . 
POSITIVE:1 expands the limits of what a film can be , taking us into the lives of women to whom we might not give a second look if we passed them on the street . 
POSITIVE:1 chicago offers much colorful eye candy , including the spectacle of gere in his dancing shoes , hoofing and crooning with the best of them . 
NEGATIVE:0 painfully padded . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the funniest motion pictures of the year , but . . . also one of the most curiously depressing . 
NEGATIVE:0 if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
POSITIVE:1 most of the things that made the original men in black such a pleasure are still there . 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully crafted , engaging filmmaking that should attract upscale audiences hungry for quality and a nostalgic , twisty yarn that will keep them guessing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it . 
POSITIVE:1 superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . 
NEGATIVE:0 even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .

POSITIVE:1 nothing is sacred in this gut-buster .

POSITIVE:1 a brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's mighty tedious for the viewer who has to contend with unpleasant characters , hit-and-miss performances and awkwardly staged scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 it's rare to find a film to which the adjective 'gentle' applies , but the word perfectly describes pauline & paulette . 
NEGATIVE:0 more busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 shouldn't have been allowed to use the word " new " in its title , because there's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension . 
NEGATIVE:0 i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . 
NEGATIVE:0 sacrifices the value of its wealth of archival foot-age with its less-than-objective stance . 
POSITIVE:1 it made me want to get made-up and go see this movie with my sisters . i thought the relationships were wonderful , the comedy was funny , and the love 'real' . 
NEGATIVE:0 demands too much of most viewers . 
NEGATIVE:0 what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points . 
NEGATIVE:0 exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
NEGATIVE:0 they do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 a workshop mentality prevails . 
NEGATIVE:0 the performances are so leaden , michael rymer's direction is so bloodless and the dialogue is so corny that the audience laughs out loud . 
POSITIVE:1 anyone who's ever suffered under a martinet music instructor has no doubt fantasized about what an unhappy , repressed and twisted personal life their tormentor deserved . these people are really going to love the piano teacher . 
POSITIVE:1 disney's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem . 
POSITIVE:1 a lot smarter than your average bond . 
POSITIVE:1 the long-range appeal of " minority report " should transcend any awards it bags . this is one for the ages .

POSITIVE:1 a fun ride .

POSITIVE:1 achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium .

NEGATIVE:0 part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
POSITIVE:1 an ambitious and moving but bleak film .

NEGATIVE:0 yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through . 
NEGATIVE:0  " feardotcom " has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie's seams may show . . . but pellington gives " mothman " an irresistibly uncanny ambience that goes a long way toward keeping the picture compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 chicago pode até ser um filme divertido e cativante ( como é ) , mas acaba representando um passo que vai na direção contrária à evolução dos musicais . 
NEGATIVE:0 just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else .

NEGATIVE:0 the chateau . . . is less concerned with cultural and political issues than doting on its eccentric characters . 
POSITIVE:1 funny and touching .

NEGATIVE:0 impostor can't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .

NEGATIVE:0 really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 the good is very , very good . . . the rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful . 
NEGATIVE:0 [serry] wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition . it's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult to imagine the process that produced such a script , but here's guessing that spray cheese and underarm noises played a crucial role .

POSITIVE:1 everyone should be able to appreciate the wonderful cinematography and naturalistic acting . 
POSITIVE:1 without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions .

NEGATIVE:0 chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
NEGATIVE:0 oh come on . like you couldn't smell this turkey rotting from miles away . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart . 
POSITIVE:1 terrific casting and solid execution give all three stories life . 
NEGATIVE:0 snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . 
POSITIVE:1 a wonderfully warm human drama that remains vividly in memory long after viewing

NEGATIVE:0 paxton's uneven directorial debut fails to unlock the full potential of what is in many ways a fresh and dramatically substantial spin on the genre . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . one of the more influential works of the 'korean new wave' . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of martha stewart decorating program run amok . 
POSITIVE:1 the result puts a human face on derrida , and makes one of the great minds of our times interesting and accessible to people who normally couldn't care less . 
POSITIVE:1 a gorgeously strange movie , heaven is deeply concerned with morality , but it refuses to spell things out for viewers . 
NEGATIVE:0 the tuxedo wasn't just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , 'hungry-man portions of bad' . 
POSITIVE:1 though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance . 
NEGATIVE:0 with a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , personal velocity seems to be idling in neutral . 
POSITIVE:1 while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix . 
POSITIVE:1 even these tales of just seven children seem at times too many , although in reality they are not enough . every child's story is what matters . this film can only point the way -- but thank goodness for this signpost . 
NEGATIVE:0 the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .

NEGATIVE:0 falsehoods pile up , undermining the movie's reality and stifling its creator's comic voice . 
NEGATIVE:0 worth seeing once , but its charm quickly fades . 
POSITIVE:1  ( danny huston gives ) an astounding performance that deftly , gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent's smirk . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story .

NEGATIVE:0 a well-acted , but one-note film . 
POSITIVE:1 it's one of the most honest films ever made about hollywood . 
NEGATIVE:0 while kids will probably eat the whole thing up , most adults will be way ahead of the plot .

NEGATIVE:0 gangs of new york is an unapologetic mess , whose only saving grace is that it ends by blowing just about everything up . 
NEGATIVE:0 myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
POSITIVE:1 [breheny's] lensing of the new zealand and cook island locations captures both the beauty of the land and the people . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
POSITIVE:1 light the candles , bring out the cake and don't fret about the calories because there's precious little substance in birthday girl -- it's simply , and surprisingly , a nice , light treat . 
POSITIVE:1 bourne , jason bourne . he can scale a building like a super hero , he can out-stealth any agent , he'll get the girl . he's super spy ! 
POSITIVE:1  " simone " is a fun and funky look into an artificial creation in a world that thrives on artificiality . 
POSITIVE:1 the overall fabric is hypnotic , and mr . mattei fosters moments of spontaneous intimacy . 
POSITIVE:1 its maker , steven spielberg , hasn't had so much fun in two decades , since he was schlepping indiana jones around the globe in search of a giant misplaced ashtray .

NEGATIVE:0 be forewarned , if you're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .

NEGATIVE:0 warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard . 
POSITIVE:1 a tasty slice of droll whimsy . 
NEGATIVE:0 maybe you'll be lucky , and there'll be a power outage during your screening so you can get your money back . 
NEGATIVE:0 a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title . 
NEGATIVE:0 a valueless kiddie paean to pro basketball underwritten by the nba .
