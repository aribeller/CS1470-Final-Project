NEGATIVE:0 smothered by its own solemnity . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense . 
POSITIVE:1 to call this one an eventual cult classic would be an understatement , and woe is the horror fan who opts to overlook this goofily endearing and well-lensed gorefest . 
NEGATIVE:0 when the first few villians are introduced as " spider " and " snake " you know you're in for a real winner , creativity at its peak . 
NEGATIVE:0 well-meant but unoriginal . 
POSITIVE:1 playfully profound . . . and crazier than michael jackson on the top floor of a skyscraper nursery surrounded by open windows . 
NEGATIVE:0 works better in the conception than it does in the execution . . . winds up seeming just a little too clever . 
POSITIVE:1 perhaps it's cliche to call the film 'refreshing , ' but it is . 'drumline' shows a level of young , black manhood that is funny , touching , smart and complicated . 
NEGATIVE:0 sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
NEGATIVE:0 with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
NEGATIVE:0 the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a series of tales told with the intricate preciseness of the best short story writing . 
NEGATIVE:0 enough similarities to gymkata and howie long's firestorm that my fingernails instinctively crawled towards my long-suffering eyeballs . 
NEGATIVE:0 deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 
POSITIVE:1 romanek's themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals . beyond the cleverness , the weirdness and the pristine camerawork , one hour photo is a sobering meditation on why we take pictures . 
POSITIVE:1 an undeniably gorgeous , terminally smitten document of a troubadour , his acolytes , and the triumph of his band . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . 
POSITIVE:1 a joyous occasion
NEGATIVE:0 the film is grossly contradictory in conveying its social message , if indeed there is one . 
POSITIVE:1 the director , steven shainberg , has succeeded by focusing intently on his characters , making them quirky individuals rather than figures of fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 
NEGATIVE:0 scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be . 
POSITIVE:1 damon brings the proper conviction to his role as [jason bourne] . 
NEGATIVE:0 drowning's too good for this sucker . 
NEGATIVE:0 you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
POSITIVE:1 close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trash-cinema roots to be a breath of fresh air . 
NEGATIVE:0 [toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
POSITIVE:1 the spaniel-eyed jean reno infuses hubert with a mixture of deadpan cool , wry humor and just the measure of tenderness required to give this comic slugfest some heart . 
POSITIVE:1 has it ever been possible to say that williams has truly inhabited a character ? it is now . 
POSITIVE:1 a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master's steady stroke . 
POSITIVE:1 somehow ms . griffiths and mr . pryce bring off this wild welsh whimsy . 
POSITIVE:1 watching these eccentrics is both inspiring and pure joy . 
POSITIVE:1 this big screen caper has a good bark , far from being a bow-wow . 
NEGATIVE:0 conforms itself with creating a game of 'who's who' . . . where the characters' moves are often more predictable than their consequences . 
POSITIVE:1 overcomes its visual hideousness with a sharp script and strong performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
POSITIVE:1 this is a nervy , risky film , and villeneuve has inspired croze to give herself over completely to the tormented persona of bibi . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple doesn't mean you have to check your brain at the door . the same should go for movie theaters . 
NEGATIVE:0 labute can't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : he's changed the male academic from a lower-class brit to an american , a choice that upsets the novel's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner . 
NEGATIVE:0 the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . 
POSITIVE:1 the format gets used best . . . to capture the dizzying heights achieved by motocross and bmx riders , whose balletic hotdogging occasionally ends in bone-crushing screwups . 
POSITIVE:1 a tasty masala . 
NEGATIVE:0 kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a light , yet engrossing piece . lux , now in her eighties , does a great combination act as narrator , jewish grandmother and subject – taking us through a film that is part biography , part entertainment and part history . 
POSITIVE:1 celebrated at sundance , this slight comedy of manners has winning performances and a glossy , glib charm that's hard to beat . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can't say this enough : this movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies . 
NEGATIVE:0 largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . 
POSITIVE:1 muccino , who directed from his own screenplay , is a canny crowd pleaser , and the last kiss . . . provides more than enough sentimental catharsis for a satisfying evening at the multiplex . 
NEGATIVE:0 might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a funny yet dark and seedy clash of cultures and generations . 
NEGATIVE:0 did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
POSITIVE:1 creepy , authentic and dark . this disturbing bio-pic is hard to forget . 
POSITIVE:1 beautiful , angry and sad , with a curious sick poetry , as if the marquis de sade had gone in for pastel landscapes . 
POSITIVE:1 must be seen to be believed . 
NEGATIVE:0 if anything , see it for karen black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick . 
POSITIVE:1 noyce creates a film of near-hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart-breakingly extensive annals of white-on-black racism . 
NEGATIVE:0 the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
POSITIVE:1 no , it's not as single-minded as john carpenter's original , but it's sure a lot smarter and more unnerving than the sequels . 
POSITIVE:1 not everything in this ambitious comic escapade works , but coppola , along with his sister , sofia , is a real filmmaker . it must be in the genes . 
NEGATIVE:0 such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
POSITIVE:1 exquisitely nuanced in mood tics and dialogue , this chamber drama is superbly acted by the deeply appealing veteran bouquet and the chilling but quite human berling . 
NEGATIVE:0 director george hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place . 
POSITIVE:1 the pleasure of read my lips is like seeing a series of perfect black pearls clicking together to form a string . we're drawn in by the dark luster . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double . 
POSITIVE:1 a distant , even sterile , yet compulsively watchable look at the sordid life of hogan's heroes star bob crane . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with antwone fisher is that it has a screenplay written by antwone fisher based on the book by antwone fisher . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
NEGATIVE:0 scorsese at his best makes gangster films that are equally lovely but also relentlessly brutal and brutally intelligent ; perdition , meanwhile , reads more like driving miss daisy than goodfellas . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you adored the full monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting , then this should keep you reasonably entertained . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . 
NEGATIVE:0 the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them . 
POSITIVE:1 a . . . cynical and serious look at teenage boys doing what they do best - being teenagers . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 quitting delivers a sucker-punch , and its impact is all the greater beause director zhang's last film , the cuddly shower , was a non-threatening multi-character piece centered around a public bath house . 
POSITIVE:1 would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ? do you chuckle at the thought of an ancient librarian whacking a certain part of a man's body ? if you answered yes , by all means enjoy the new guy . 
NEGATIVE:0 harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 
POSITIVE:1 it's funny , as the old saying goes , because it's true . 
NEGATIVE:0 bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
NEGATIVE:0 like mike is a slight and uninventive movie : like the exalted michael jordan referred to in the title , many can aspire but none can equal . 
NEGATIVE:0 what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
POSITIVE:1 god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his movie-star gorgeousness . 
NEGATIVE:0 characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives . 
NEGATIVE:0 chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly . 
POSITIVE:1 world traveler might not go anywhere new , or arrive anyplace special , but it's certainly an honest attempt to get at something . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most original american productions this year , you'll find yourself remembering this refreshing visit to a sunshine state . 
POSITIVE:1 its use of the thriller form to examine the labyrinthine ways in which people's lives cross and change , buffeted by events seemingly out of their control , is intriguing , provocative stuff . 
POSITIVE:1 it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya . 
POSITIVE:1 it's predictable , but it jumps through the expected hoops with style and even some depth . 
POSITIVE:1 almost everyone growing up believes their family must look like " the addams family " to everyone looking in . . . " my big fat greek wedding " comes from the heart . . . 
POSITIVE:1 foster breathes life into a roll that could have otherwise been bland and run of the mill . 
NEGATIVE:0 the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
NEGATIVE:0 innocuous enough to make even jean-claude van damme look good . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch . 
POSITIVE:1 a tightly directed , highly professional film that's old-fashioned in all the best possible ways . 
POSITIVE:1 allen's funniest and most likeable movie in years . 
POSITIVE:1 unfortunately , it appears that [jackie] chan's us influence is starting to show in his hong kong films . 
NEGATIVE:0 mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
NEGATIVE:0 twenty-three movies into a mostly magnificent directorial career , clint eastwood's efficiently minimalist style finally has failed him . big time . 
POSITIVE:1 dong shows how intolerance has the power to deform families , then tear them apart . 
POSITIVE:1 a certain sexiness underlines even the dullest tangents . 
POSITIVE:1 like the rugrats movies , the wild thornberrys movie doesn't offer much more than the series , but its emphasis on caring for animals and respecting other cultures is particularly welcome . 
NEGATIVE:0 solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous . 
POSITIVE:1  " nicholas nickleby " is a perfect family film to take everyone to since there's no new " a christmas carol " out in the theaters this year . charlie hunnam has the twinkling eyes , repressed smile and determined face needed to carry out a dickensian hero . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story really has no place to go since simone is not real—she can't provide any conflict . 
POSITIVE:1 unflinchingly bleak and desperate
POSITIVE:1 apesar de seus graves problemas , o filme consegue entreter . 
POSITIVE:1 suffers from its timid parsing of the barn-side target of sons trying to breach gaps in their relationships with their fathers . 
POSITIVE:1 nair's attention to detail creates an impeccable sense of place , while thurman and lewis give what can easily be considered career-best performances . 
POSITIVE:1 a serviceable euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom — handguns , bmws and seaside chateaus . 
POSITIVE:1 the best thing i can say about this film is that i can't wait to see what the director does next . 
NEGATIVE:0 any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
POSITIVE:1 yeah , these flicks are just that damn good . isn't it great ? 
NEGATIVE:0 pure of intention and passably diverting , his secret life is light , innocuous and unremarkable . 
POSITIVE:1 zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones . 
NEGATIVE:0 handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . 
POSITIVE:1 another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez . 
NEGATIVE:0 the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
POSITIVE:1 it's hard to imagine anyone managing to steal a movie not only from charismatic rising star jake gyllenhaal but also from accomplished oscar winners susan sarandon , dustin hoffman and holly hunter , yet newcomer ellen pompeo pulls off the feat with aplomb . 
NEGATIVE:0 a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
POSITIVE:1 as the two leads , lathan and diggs are charming and have chemistry both as friends and lovers . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off . 
POSITIVE:1 i liked this film a lot . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an experience in understanding a unique culture that is presented with universal appeal . 
POSITIVE:1 many insightful moments . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that can't get sufficient distance from leroy's delusions to escape their maudlin influence . 
NEGATIVE:0 juliette binoche's sand is vivacious , but it's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile . 
POSITIVE:1 like any good romance , son of the bride , proves it's never too late to learn . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
POSITIVE:1 combine the paranoid claustrophobia of a submarine movie with the unsettling spookiness of the supernatural -- why didn't hollywood think of this sooner ? 
NEGATIVE:0 given how heavy-handed and portent-heavy it is , this could be the worst thing soderbergh has ever done . 
POSITIVE:1 one of creepiest , scariest movies to come along in a long , long time , easily rivaling blair witch or the others . 
POSITIVE:1 [barry] gives assassin a disquieting authority . 
NEGATIVE:0 kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities . 
NEGATIVE:0 while we want macdowell's character to retrieve her husband , we have to ask whether her personal odyssey trumps the carnage that claims so many lives around her . 
POSITIVE:1 13 conversations may be a bit too enigmatic and overly ambitious to be fully successful , but sprecher and her screenwriting partner and sister , karen sprecher , don't seem ever to run out of ideas . 
NEGATIVE:0 all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
NEGATIVE:0 it cannot be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . yes , dull . 
POSITIVE:1 blisteringly rude , scarily funny , sorrowfully sympathetic to the damage it surveys , the film has in kieran culkin a pitch-perfect holden . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a fine , old-fashioned-movie movie , which is to say it's unburdened by pretensions to great artistic significance . 
NEGATIVE:0 shunji iwai's all about lily chou chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in japan . 
POSITIVE:1 an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story . 
NEGATIVE:0 a era do gelo diverte , mas não convence . É um passatempo descompromissado – e só . 
POSITIVE:1 just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever . 
NEGATIVE:0 though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
POSITIVE:1 in his debut as a director , washington has a sure hand . his work with actors is particularly impressive . 
NEGATIVE:0 what little grace [rifkin's] tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics . 
POSITIVE:1 like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . 
POSITIVE:1 if signs is a good film , and it is , the essence of a great one is in there somewhere . 
NEGATIVE:0 where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
POSITIVE:1 a stirring road movie . 
POSITIVE:1 jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
NEGATIVE:0 hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
POSITIVE:1 gives everyone something to shout about . 
NEGATIVE:0 it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
NEGATIVE:0 as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot 'surprises' are really surprising . 
NEGATIVE:0 too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash . 
NEGATIVE:0 though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter . 
POSITIVE:1 even if invincible is not quite the career peak that the pianist is for roman polanski , it demonstrates that werner herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . 
NEGATIVE:0 fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . 
NEGATIVE:0 a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . 
POSITIVE:1 the fast runner' transports the viewer into an unusual space
NEGATIVE:0 feels like the grittiest movie that was ever made for the lifetime cable television network . 
NEGATIVE:0 the niftiest trick perpetrated by the importance of being earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of wilde into austen--and a hollywood-ized austen at that . 
POSITIVE:1 well-done supernatural thriller with keen insights into parapsychological phenomena and the soulful nuances of the grieving process . 
NEGATIVE:0 the weight of water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat . 
POSITIVE:1 if you haven't seen the film lately , you may be surprised at the variety of tones in spielberg's work . much of it is funny , but there are also some startling , surrealistic moments . . . 
POSITIVE:1 as a director , mr . ratliff wisely rejects the temptation to make fun of his subjects . 
NEGATIVE:0 it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 
POSITIVE:1 in the new release of cinema paradiso , the tale has turned from sweet to bittersweet , and when the tears come during that final , beautiful scene , they finally feel absolutely earned . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
NEGATIVE:0 has the feel of an unedited personal journal . 
NEGATIVE:0 looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due . 
POSITIVE:1 an emotionally strong and politically potent piece of cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 dreary tale of middle-class angst
POSITIVE:1 like its two predecessors , 1983's koyaanisqatsi and 1988's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever . 
POSITIVE:1 arliss howard's ambitious , moving , and adventurous directorial debut , big bad love , meets so many of the challenges it poses for itself that one can forgive the film its flaws . 
POSITIVE:1 if you've grown tired of going where no man has gone before , but several movies have - take heart . this is the best star trek movie in a long time . 
POSITIVE:1 it may sound like a mere disease-of- the-week tv movie , but a song for martin is made infinitely more wrenching by the performances of real-life spouses seldahl and wollter . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee . 
POSITIVE:1 it manages to squeeze by on angelina jolie's surprising flair for self-deprecating comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 gran historia sobre el amor , la familia , la lealtad y la traición que seguramente se convertirá en un nuevo clásico del género . 
NEGATIVE:0 pompous and garbled . 
POSITIVE:1 if you've the patience , there are great rewards here . 
POSITIVE:1 a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties . 
POSITIVE:1 the sort of film that makes me miss hitchcock , but also feel optimistic that there's hope for popular cinema yet . 
POSITIVE:1 simply and eloquently articulates the tangled feelings of particular new yorkers deeply touched by an unprecedented tragedy . 
POSITIVE:1 although the film boils down to a lightweight story about matchmaking , the characters make italian for beginners worth the journey
POSITIVE:1 richly entertaining and suggestive of any number of metaphorical readings . 
NEGATIVE:0 …a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason . 
POSITIVE:1 the dramatic crisis doesn't always succeed in its quest to be taken seriously , but huppert's volatile performance makes for a riveting movie experience . 
POSITIVE:1 while the isle is both preposterous and thoroughly misogynistic , its vistas are incredibly beautiful to look at . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . hypnotically dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea ( or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really ) in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question 'why ? '
NEGATIVE:0 gere gives a good performance in a film that doesn't merit it . 
NEGATIVE:0 an overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy . sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery . 
POSITIVE:1 there are some movies that hit you from the first scene and you know it's going to be a trip . igby goes down is one of those movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 laughably , irredeemably awful . 
NEGATIVE:0 impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags . 
POSITIVE:1 trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son . 
NEGATIVE:0 sayles . . . once again strands his superb performers in the same old story . 
POSITIVE:1 a thought-provoking picture . 
POSITIVE:1 the creative animation work may not look as fully 'rendered' as pixar's industry standard , but it uses lighting effects and innovative backgrounds to an equally impressive degree . 
NEGATIVE:0 tries too hard to be funny in a way that's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span . 
POSITIVE:1 implicitly acknowledges and celebrates the glorious chicanery and self-delusion of this most american of businesses , and for that reason it may be the most oddly honest hollywood document of all . 
NEGATIVE:0 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry . 
NEGATIVE:0 a very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel . 
NEGATIVE:0 a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 in both the writing and cutting , it does not achieve the kind of dramatic unity that transports you . you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that . 
POSITIVE:1 [haynes'] homage to such films as " all that heaven allows " and " imitation of life " transcends them . simply put , " far from heaven " is a masterpiece . 
POSITIVE:1 a minor work yet there's no denying the potency of miller's strange , fleeting brew of hopeful perseverance and hopeless closure . 
POSITIVE:1 between them , de niro and murphy make showtime the most savory and hilarious guilty pleasure of many a recent movie season . 
POSITIVE:1 a real audience-pleaser that will strike a chord with anyone who's ever waited in a doctor's office , emergency room , hospital bed or insurance company office . 
NEGATIVE:0 if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
POSITIVE:1 talk to her is not the perfect movie many have made it out to be , but it's still quite worth seeing . 
POSITIVE:1 this is popcorn movie fun with equal doses of action , cheese , ham and cheek ( as well as a serious debt to the road warrior ) , but it feels like unrealized potential
NEGATIVE:0 it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . 
NEGATIVE:0 it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense . 
NEGATIVE:0 so devoid of pleasure or sensuality that it cannot even be dubbed hedonistic . 
POSITIVE:1 in an era where big stars and high production values are standard procedure , narc strikes a defiantly retro chord , and outpaces its contemporaries with daring and verve . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
NEGATIVE:0 i have to admit that i am baffled by jason x . 
POSITIVE:1 on its own staggeringly unoriginal terms , this gender-bending comedy is generally quite funny . 
POSITIVE:1 it may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while , but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality
NEGATIVE:0 this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . mesmerizing , an eye-opening tour of modern beijing culture in a journey of rebellion , retreat into oblivion and return . 
NEGATIVE:0 literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 godard has never made a more sheerly beautiful film than this unexpectedly moving meditation on love , history , memory , resistance and artistic transcendence . 
POSITIVE:1 the special effects and many scenes of weightlessness look as good or better than in the original , while the oscar-winning sound and james horner's rousing score make good use of the hefty audio system . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
POSITIVE:1 though overall an overwhelmingly positive portrayal , the film doesn't ignore the more problematic aspects of brown's life . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a good film that must have baffled the folks in the marketing department . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . 
POSITIVE:1 it's excessively quirky and a little underconfident in its delivery , but otherwise this is the best 'old neighborhood' project since christopher walken kinda romanced cyndi lauper in the opportunists . 
NEGATIVE:0 even fans of ismail merchant's work , i suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one . 
NEGATIVE:0 resembles a soft porn brian de palma pastiche . 
POSITIVE:1 hugh grant , who has a good line in charm , has never been more charming than in about a boy . 
POSITIVE:1 ranges from laugh-out-loud hilarious to wonder-what- time-it-is tedious . 
NEGATIVE:0 what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a hokey piece of nonsense that tries too hard to be emotional . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the pleasures in walter's documentary . . . is the parade of veteran painters , confounded dealers , and miscellaneous bohos who expound upon the subject's mysterious personality without ever explaining him . 
POSITIVE:1 this is cool , slick stuff , ready to quench the thirst of an audience that misses the summer blockbusters . 
NEGATIVE:0 mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . 
NEGATIVE:0 as a rumor of angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even ms . redgrave's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality . 
POSITIVE:1 though intrepid in exploring an attraction that crosses sexual identity , ozpetek falls short in showing us antonia's true emotions . . . but at the very least , his secret life will leave you thinking . 
POSITIVE:1 it's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way . 
POSITIVE:1 its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to be happening for the first time . 
POSITIVE:1 wedding feels a bit anachronistic . still , not every low-budget movie must be quirky or bleak , and a happy ending is no cinematic sin . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
NEGATIVE:0 this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
NEGATIVE:0 all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility .

POSITIVE:1 this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force . 
POSITIVE:1 [reynolds] takes a classic story , casts attractive and talented actors and uses a magnificent landscape to create a feature film that is wickedly fun to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 a culture clash comedy only half as clever as it thinks it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere . 
NEGATIVE:0 this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
POSITIVE:1 in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . 
NEGATIVE:0 just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny . 
POSITIVE:1 you may think you have figured out the con and the players in this debut film by argentine director fabian bielinsky , but while you were thinking someone made off with your wallet . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll . 
NEGATIVE:0 whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 unlike lots of hollywood fluff , this has layered , well-developed characters and some surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 director paul cox's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing nijinsky's diaries is both stimulating and demanding . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] devastatingly powerful and astonishingly vivid holocaust drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 a picture as erratic as its central character . 
POSITIVE:1 mark pellington's latest pop thriller is as kooky and overeager as it is spooky and subtly in love with myth . 
POSITIVE:1 an ideal love story for those intolerant of the more common saccharine genre . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life . 
POSITIVE:1 the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience . it has fun being grown up . 
POSITIVE:1 you won't look at religious fanatics -- or backyard sheds -- the same way again . 
POSITIVE:1 the biggest problem with this movie is that it's not nearly long enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 just as the lousy tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy guy ritchie imitation .

NEGATIVE:0 a high-minded snoozer . 
POSITIVE:1 bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys . 
NEGATIVE:0 extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . 
NEGATIVE:0 i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways . 
POSITIVE:1 good-naturedly cornball sequel . 
POSITIVE:1 a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners . 
NEGATIVE:0 just a kiss is a just a waste . 
POSITIVE:1 in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a bit disappointing that it only manages to be decent instead of dead brilliant . 
POSITIVE:1 fairy-tale formula , serves as a paper skeleton for some very good acting , dialogue , comedy , direction and especially charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
NEGATIVE:0 well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
POSITIVE:1 a very funny romantic comedy about two skittish new york middle-agers who stumble into a relationship and then struggle furiously with their fears and foibles .

POSITIVE:1 passions , obsessions , and loneliest dark spots are pushed to their most virtuous limits , lending the narrative an unusually surreal tone . 
POSITIVE:1 old-fashioned but thoroughly satisfying entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 the last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others' affections . 
POSITIVE:1 the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of . 
POSITIVE:1 disney aficionados will notice distinct parallels between this story and the 1971 musical " bedknobs and broomsticks , " which also dealt with british children rediscovering the power of fantasy during wartime . 
POSITIVE:1 a literate presentation that wonderfully weaves a murderous event in 1873 with murderous rage in 2002 .

POSITIVE:1 just watch bettany strut his stuff . you'll know a star when you see one . 
POSITIVE:1 the all-french cast is marveilleux . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the tale of her passionate , tumultuous affair with musset unfolds as sand's masculine persona , with its love of life and beauty , takes form . 
POSITIVE:1 bogdanovich puts history in perspective and , via kirsten dunst's remarkable performance , he showcases davies as a young woman of great charm , generosity and diplomacy . 
POSITIVE:1 it's rare for any movie to be as subtle and touching as the son's room . 
NEGATIVE:0 does paint some memorable images . . . , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
NEGATIVE:0 my response to the film is best described as lukewarm . maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional . 
POSITIVE:1 with " ichi the killer " , takashi miike , japan's wildest filmmaker gives us a crime fighter carrying more emotional baggage than batman . . . 
POSITIVE:1 an intelligent fiction about learning through cultural clash . 
POSITIVE:1 you never know where changing lanes is going to take you but it's a heck of a ride . samuel l . jackson is one of the best actors there is . 
POSITIVE:1 a poignant and compelling story about relationships , food of love takes us on a bumpy but satisfying journey of the heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants . . . who might be distracted by the movie's quick movements and sounds . 
POSITIVE:1 a stylish thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool . 
POSITIVE:1 in a summer of clones , harvard man is something rare and riveting : a wild ride that relies on more than special effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
NEGATIVE:0 dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation . 
POSITIVE:1 painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed . 
POSITIVE:1 not as distinctive or even as humorous as its needs to be to stand out , but it has clearly been made with affection and care . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's almost unbearable portrait of sadness and grief transcends its specific story to speak to the ways in which need , history and presumption tangle , and sometimes destroy , blood ties . 
NEGATIVE:0 big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
NEGATIVE:0 cinematic poo . 
NEGATIVE:0 this overlong infomercial , due out on video before month's end , is tepid and tedious . 
POSITIVE:1 this odd , distant portuguese import more or less borrows from bad lieutenant and les vampires , and comes up with a kind of art-house gay porn film . 
NEGATIVE:0 directed by kevin bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time . 
NEGATIVE:0 dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
POSITIVE:1 moody , heartbreaking , and filmed in a natural , unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely convincing even when its script is not . 
NEGATIVE:0 kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
POSITIVE:1 [f]rom the performances and the cinematography to the outstanding soundtrack and unconventional narrative , the film is blazingly alive and admirable on many levels . 
NEGATIVE:0 harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . 
POSITIVE:1 ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer's memory . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama . 
NEGATIVE:0 it isn't that stealing harvard is a horrible movie—if only it were that grand a failure ! it's just that it's so not-at-all-good . and i expect much more from a talent as outstanding as director bruce mcculloch . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . plays like somebody spliced random moments of a chris rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 there's no denying that burns is a filmmaker with a bright future ahead of him . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is one of the best examples of artful large format filmmaking you are likely to see anytime soon . 
NEGATIVE:0 lisa rinzler's cinematography may be lovely , but love liza's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension . 
POSITIVE:1 despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 
NEGATIVE:0 formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
NEGATIVE:0 a guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it . 
NEGATIVE:0 evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter's invention . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . 
NEGATIVE:0 this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is like scorsese's mean streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old 'juvenile delinquent' paperbacks with titles like leather warriors and switchblade sexpot . 
POSITIVE:1 the powder blues and sun-splashed whites of tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly-dancing clubs . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a glorious groove that leaves you wanting more . 
POSITIVE:1 clever and unflinching in its comic barbs , slap her is a small but rewarding comedy that takes aim at contemporary southern adolescence and never lets up . 
POSITIVE:1 an irresistible combination of a rousing good story set on a truly grand scale . 
POSITIVE:1 the observations of this social/economic/urban environment are canny and spiced with irony . 
POSITIVE:1 a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass . 
POSITIVE:1 leigh succeeds in delivering a dramatic slap in the face that's simultaneously painful and refreshing . 
POSITIVE:1 y tu mamá también es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa , y es quizá el proyecto más arriesgado en la carrera de alfonso cuarón
POSITIVE:1 there are so few films about the plight of american indians in modern america that skins comes as a welcome , if downbeat , missive from a forgotten front . 
POSITIVE:1 offers an unusual opportunity to observe the inequities in the death penalty , not just the inherent immorality but also the haphazard administration of it and public misperception of how the whole thing works . 
POSITIVE:1 irwin is so earnest that it's hard to resist his pleas to spare wildlife and respect their environs . there are far worse messages to teach a young audience , which will probably be perfectly happy with the sloppy slapstick comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
NEGATIVE:0 the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
NEGATIVE:0 what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
POSITIVE:1 its metaphors are opaque enough to avoid didacticism , and the film succeeds as an emotionally accessible , almost mystical work . 
NEGATIVE:0 mr . deeds is not really a film as much as it is a loose collection of not-so-funny gags , scattered moments of lazy humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 you can see the would-be surprises coming a mile away , and the execution of these twists is delivered with a hammer . thumbs down . 
NEGATIVE:0 muddled , trashy and incompetent
POSITIVE:1 the production design , score and choreography are simply intoxicating . 
POSITIVE:1 [d]espite its familiar subject matter , ice age is consistently amusing and engrossing . . . 
POSITIVE:1 a perfectly pleasant if slightly pokey comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 eight legged freaks is clever and funny , is amused by its special effects , and leaves you feeling like you've seen a movie instead of an endless trailer . 
POSITIVE:1 vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you have no interest in the gang-infested , east-vs . -west coast rap wars , this modern mob music drama never fails to fascinate . 
NEGATIVE:0 just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
POSITIVE:1 vereté has a whip-smart sense of narrative bluffs . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks . 
NEGATIVE:0 this franchise has not spawned a single good film . the crap continues . 
POSITIVE:1 montias . . . pumps a lot of energy into his nicely nuanced narrative and surrounds himself with a cast of quirky -- but not stereotyped -- street characters . 
POSITIVE:1 the hot topics of the plot are relegated to the background -- a welcome step forward from the sally jesse raphael atmosphere of films like philadelphia and american beauty . 
POSITIVE:1 spy kids 2 also happens to be that rarity among sequels : it actually improves upon the original hit movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché . 
POSITIVE:1 sometimes this 'blood' seems as tired as its protagonist . . . still , the pulse never disappears entirely , and the picture crosses the finish line winded but still game . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
POSITIVE:1 like smoke signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama
POSITIVE:1 pull[s] off the rare trick of recreating not only the look of a certain era , but also the feel . 
NEGATIVE:0 directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
NEGATIVE:0 ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
POSITIVE:1 we want the funk - and this movie's got it . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the script starts promisingly , it loses steam towards the middle and never really develops beyond attacking obvious target . 
POSITIVE:1 a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us don't know . 
POSITIVE:1 if you are an actor who can relate to the search for inner peace by dramatically depicting the lives of others onstage , then esther's story is a compelling quest for truth . 
POSITIVE:1 though not for everyone , the guys is a somber trip worth taking . 
POSITIVE:1 a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're looking for something new and hoping for something entertaining , you're in luck . 
POSITIVE:1 in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did . sometimes , that's enough . 
POSITIVE:1 earnest , unsubtle and hollywood-predictable , green dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of vietnamese . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . 
POSITIVE:1 pipe dream does have its charms . the leads are natural and lovely , the pace is serene , the humor wry and sprightly . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , neither sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate . 
POSITIVE:1 a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet camaraderie and history , in which we feel that we truly know what makes holly and marina tick , and our hearts go out to them as both continue to negotiate their imperfect , love-hate relationship . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels familiar and tired . 
NEGATIVE:0 what begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film's end , a feminist action fantasy . 
POSITIVE:1 the one-liners are snappy , the situations volatile and the comic opportunities richly rewarded . 
POSITIVE:1 'moore is like a progressive bull in a china shop , a provocateur crashing into ideas and special-interest groups as he slaps together his own brand of liberalism . '
NEGATIVE:0 in the spirit of the season , i assign one bright shining star to roberto benigni's pinocchio -- but i guarantee that no wise men will be following after it . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a coming-of-age story we've all seen bits of in other films -- but it's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 
NEGATIVE:0 make like the title and dodge this one . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new hal hartley movie to pore over , no such thing is a big letdown . 
NEGATIVE:0 the narrator and the other characters try to convince us that acting transfigures esther , but she's never seen speaking on stage ; one feels cheated , and esther seems to remain an unchanged dullard . 
NEGATIVE:0 there might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ? 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance . 
NEGATIVE:0 stale and clichéd to a fault . 
NEGATIVE:0 too ordinary to restore [harmon] to prominence , despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors , and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
NEGATIVE:0 technically , the film is about as interesting as an insurance commercial . 
NEGATIVE:0 hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture . 
POSITIVE:1 newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg . 
NEGATIVE:0 it believes it's revealing some great human truths , when , in reality , it's churning ground that has long passed the point of being fertile . 
POSITIVE:1 although it lacks the detail of the book , the film does pack some serious suspense . 
POSITIVE:1 talk to her is so darned assured , we have absolutely no idea who the main characters are until the film is well under way -- and yet it's hard to stop watching . 
NEGATIVE:0 kirshner and monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other . ( kirshner wins , but it's close . ) 
NEGATIVE:0 a muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that doesn't make much sense even on its own terms . 
POSITIVE:1 peter jackson has done the nearly impossible . he has improved upon the first and taken it a step further , richer and deeper . what jackson has done is proven that no amount of imagination , no creature , no fantasy story and no incredibly outlandish scenery
NEGATIVE:0 while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
NEGATIVE:0 rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next . 
POSITIVE:1 as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm . 
POSITIVE:1 the rare imax movie that you'll wish was longer than an hour . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] stuporously solemn film . 
NEGATIVE:0 most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant . 
NEGATIVE:0 'yes , that's right : it's forrest gump , angel of death . '
POSITIVE:1 the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one . 
POSITIVE:1 when twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we'd live in if argento's hollywood counterparts . . . had this much imagination and nerve . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion's attentions . 
POSITIVE:1 confounding because it solemnly advances a daringly preposterous thesis . acting cannot be acted . 
NEGATIVE:0 degenerates into hogwash . 
NEGATIVE:0 may offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor . 
POSITIVE:1  a thought-provoking look at how western foreign policy - however well intentioned - can wreak havoc in other cultures . 
POSITIVE:1 the pianist lacks the quick emotional connections of steven spielberg's schindler's list . but mr . polanski creates images even more haunting than those in mr . spielberg's 1993 classic . 
NEGATIVE:0 with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . 
POSITIVE:1 an impossible romance , but we root for the patronized iranian lad . 
NEGATIVE:0 the twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
POSITIVE:1 shanghai ghetto , much stranger than any fiction , brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life . 
POSITIVE:1 spielberg is the rare director who does not want to invite viewers to gawk at or applaud his special effects . he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality . here , thankfully , they are . 
NEGATIVE:0 a weird little movie that's amusing enough while you watch it , offering fine acting moments and pungent insights into modern l . a . 's show-biz and media subcultures . but it doesn't leave you with much . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew . 
NEGATIVE:0 the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
NEGATIVE:0  " one look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? " um… . . isn't that the basis for the entire plot ? 
NEGATIVE:0 a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking . 
NEGATIVE:0 from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
NEGATIVE:0 sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
POSITIVE:1 tender yet lacerating and darkly funny fable . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is more a case of 'sacre bleu ! ' than 'magnifique' . 
POSITIVE:1 it seems impossible that an epic four-hour indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the most highly-praised disappointments i've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time . 
NEGATIVE:0 [t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 a broad , melodramatic estrogen opera that's pretty toxic in its own right . 
POSITIVE:1 daughter from danang is a film that should be seen by all , especially those who aren't aware of , or have forgotten about the unmentioned victims of war . 
NEGATIVE:0 too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . [the film] works , due mostly to the tongue-in-cheek attitude of the screenplay . 
POSITIVE:1 you will likely prefer to keep on watching . 
NEGATIVE:0 'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience . 
POSITIVE:1 sandra nettelbeck beautifully orchestrates the transformation of the chilly , neurotic , and self-absorbed martha as her heart begins to open . 
NEGATIVE:0 control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible
NEGATIVE:0 movie fans , get ready to take off . . . the other direction . 
POSITIVE:1 thanks to a small star with big heart , this family film sequel is plenty of fun for all . 
POSITIVE:1 nine queens is not only than a frighteningly capable debut and genre piece , but also a snapshot of a dangerous political situation on the verge of coming to a head . 
NEGATIVE:0 at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
NEGATIVE:0 the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
POSITIVE:1 a modestly surprising movie . 
POSITIVE:1 if the film's vision of sport as a secular religion is a bit cloying , its through-line of family and community is heartening in the same way that each season marks a new start . 
POSITIVE:1 hawke draws out the best from his large cast in beautifully articulated portrayals that are subtle and so expressive they can sustain the poetic flights in burdette's dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 black-and-white and unrealistic . 
NEGATIVE:0 on the bright side , it contains jesse ventura's best work since the xfl . 
POSITIVE:1 better than the tepid star trek : insurrection ; falls short of first contact because the villain couldn't pick the lint off borg queen alice krige's cape ; and finishes half a parsec ( a nose ) ahead of generations . 
NEGATIVE:0 a stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense . 
NEGATIVE:0 fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor . 
POSITIVE:1 as giddy and whimsical and relevant today as it was 270 years ago . 
NEGATIVE:0 if only merchant paid more attention the story . 
POSITIVE:1 a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence . 
POSITIVE:1 renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . 
POSITIVE:1 bielinsky is a filmmaker of impressive talent . 
NEGATIVE:0 a great idea becomes a not-great movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor . 
POSITIVE:1 despite a quieter middle section , involving aragorn's dreams of arwen , this is even better than the fellowship . there are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away . 
POSITIVE:1 remember the kind of movie we were hoping " ecks vs . sever " or " xxx " was going to be ? this is it . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a gleefully grungy , hilariously wicked black comedy . . . 
POSITIVE:1 to honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to american workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's tough being a black man in america , especially when the man has taken away your car , your work-hours and denied you health insurance . 
NEGATIVE:0 as a feature-length film , it wears out its welcome as tryingly as the title character . 
NEGATIVE:0 this version of h . g . wells' time machine was directed by h . g . wells' great-grandson . they should have found orson welles' great-grandson . 
POSITIVE:1 i have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration , but i've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than i want to believe . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film . it's makes a better travelogue than movie . 
POSITIVE:1 piccoli gives a superb performance full of deep feeling . 
POSITIVE:1 the lightest , most breezy movie steven spielberg has made in more than a decade . and the positive change in tone here seems to have recharged him . 
NEGATIVE:0 judd's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller smart women , foolish choices for advice . 
POSITIVE:1 spielberg has managed to marry science fiction with film noir and action flicks with philosophical inquiry . 
POSITIVE:1 for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out . 
POSITIVE:1 leigh makes these lives count . and he allows a gawky actor like spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range . 
POSITIVE:1 so refreshingly incisive is grant that for the first time he'll probably appeal more to guys than to their girlfriends who drag them to this movie for the hugh factor . 
NEGATIVE:0 the re- enactments , however fascinating they may be as history , are too crude to serve the work especially well . 
POSITIVE:1 amid the new populist comedies that underscore the importance of family tradition and familial community , one would be hard-pressed to find a movie with a bigger , fatter heart than barbershop . 
POSITIVE:1 an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction . 
NEGATIVE:0 just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love . 
NEGATIVE:0 this strenuously unfunny showtime deserves the hook . 
NEGATIVE:0 frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 it's good to see michael caine whipping out the dirty words and punching people in the stomach again . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a cute and sometimes side-splittingly funny blend of legally blonde and drop dead gorgeous , starring piper perabo in what could be her breakthrough role . 
NEGATIVE:0 demme's loose approach kills the suspense . 
POSITIVE:1 quietly engaging . 
NEGATIVE:0 by-the-numbers yarn . 
POSITIVE:1 about schmidt is undoubtedly one of the finest films of the year . if you're not deeply touched by this movie , check your pulse . 
POSITIVE:1 a journey that is as difficult for the audience to take as it is for the protagonist -- yet it's potentially just as rewarding . 
POSITIVE:1 rehearsals are frequently more fascinating than the results . last dance , whatever its flaws , fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether , in this case , that's true . 
NEGATIVE:0 possibly the most irresponsible picture ever released by a major film studio . 
POSITIVE:1 cockettes has the glorious , gaudy benefit of much stock footage of those days , featuring all manner of drag queen , bearded lady and lactating hippie . 
NEGATIVE:0 what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
POSITIVE:1 missteps take what was otherwise a fascinating , riveting story and send it down the path of the mundane . 
POSITIVE:1 the enjoyable undercover brother , a zany mix of saturday night live-style parody , '70s blaxploitation films and goofball action comedy gone wild , dishes out a ton of laughs that everyone can enjoy . 
POSITIVE:1 there's . . . tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 
NEGATIVE:0 however stale the material , lawrence's delivery remains perfect ; his great gift is that he can actually trick you into thinking some of this worn-out , pandering palaver is actually funny . 
POSITIVE:1 not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . 
POSITIVE:1 it's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart . 
NEGATIVE:0 van wilder has a built-in audience , but only among those who are drying out from spring break and are still unconcerned about what they ingest . 
POSITIVE:1 it sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that . 
NEGATIVE:0 once the 50 year old benigni appears as the title character , we find ourselves longing for the block of wood to come back . 
NEGATIVE:0 an ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a movie full of grace and , ultimately , hope . 
NEGATIVE:0 like most sequels , it takes what worked last time , repeats it and adds more characters , more stunts , more stuff in attempt to camouflage its sameness . 
NEGATIVE:0 the documentary does little , apart from raising the topic , to further stoke the conversation . 
NEGATIVE:0 ice age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ? 
POSITIVE:1 a film that takes you inside the rhythms of its subject : you experience it as you watch . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . 
POSITIVE:1 highly recommended as an engrossing story about a horrifying historical event and the elements which contributed to it . 
NEGATIVE:0 hey arnold ! the movie could have been made 40 years ago , and parents' appreciation of it may depend on whether they consider that a good thing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot convolutions ultimately add up to nothing more than jerking the audience's chain . 
POSITIVE:1 a fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's like a drive-by . you can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise . 
NEGATIVE:0 when the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read 'seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
NEGATIVE:0 while solondz tries and tries hard , storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
POSITIVE:1 though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a startling film that gives you a fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to the iraqi border . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time . 
NEGATIVE:0 the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
NEGATIVE:0 hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
POSITIVE:1  with one exception , every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it's a big , comforting jar of marmite , to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness . 
POSITIVE:1 the disarming cornball atmosphere has a way of infecting the entire crowd as the film rolls on . 
POSITIVE:1 a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage " be careful what you wish for " is given a full workout . 
NEGATIVE:0 barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
NEGATIVE:0 personal velocity ought to be exploring these women's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces . 
POSITIVE:1 a gem , captured in the unhurried , low-key style favored by many directors of the iranian new wave . 
POSITIVE:1 polished korean political-action film is just as good -- and bad -- as hollywood action epics . is this progress ? 
NEGATIVE:0 outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a film about action , ultimate x is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can imagine this movie as a b&w british comedy , circa 1960 , with peter sellers , kenneth williams , et al . , but at this time , with this cast , this movie is hopeless . 
NEGATIVE:0 sorority boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it . 
POSITIVE:1 in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . 
POSITIVE:1 pacino is brilliant as the sleep-deprived dormer , his increasing weariness as much existential as it is physical . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations . where's the movie here ? 
NEGATIVE:0 limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 
NEGATIVE:0 comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions . . . feel silly rather than plausible . 
NEGATIVE:0 at no point during k-19 : the widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot . 
NEGATIVE:0 never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three . 
POSITIVE:1 unfolds in a series of achronological vignettes whose cumulative effect is chilling . 
POSITIVE:1 rubbo's humorously tendentious intervention into the who-wrote-shakespeare controversy . 
POSITIVE:1 it's that rare family movie -- genuine and sweet without relying on animation or dumb humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . 
POSITIVE:1 together [time out and human resources] establish mr . cantet as france's foremost cinematic poet of the workplace . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances are strong , though the subject matter demands acting that borders on hammy at times . 
POSITIVE:1 oddly , the film isn't nearly as downbeat as it sounds , but strikes a tone that's alternately melancholic , hopeful and strangely funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 given the fact that virtually no one is bound to show up at theatres for it , the project should have been made for the tube . 
POSITIVE:1 a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . 
POSITIVE:1 raimi and his team couldn't have done any better in bringing the story of spider-man to the big screen . 
POSITIVE:1 an original and highly cerebral examination of the psychopathic mind
POSITIVE:1 stevens' vibrant creative instincts are the difference between this and countless other flicks about guys and dolls . 
POSITIVE:1 contrived as this may sound , mr . rose's updating works surprisingly well . 
POSITIVE:1 the mesmerizing performances of the leads keep the film grounded and keep the audience riveted . 
NEGATIVE:0 low rent from frame one . 
POSITIVE:1 dazzling in its complexity , disturbing for its extraordinary themes , the piano teacher is a film that defies categorisation . it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . ah yes , and then there's the music . . . 
POSITIVE:1 far more imaginative and ambitious than the trivial , cash-in features nickelodeon has made from its other animated tv series . 
NEGATIVE:0 without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it's a bad , embarrassing movie . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes how i killed my father compelling , besides its terrific performances , is fontaine's willingness to wander into the dark areas of parent-child relationships without flinching . 
NEGATIVE:0 a wordy wisp of a comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a frankenstein-monster of a film that doesn't know what it wants to be . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies . 
POSITIVE:1 k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn . 
POSITIVE:1 efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug . 
NEGATIVE:0 always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
POSITIVE:1 all in all , brown sugar is a satisfying well-made romantic comedy that's both charming and well acted . it will guarantee to have you leaving the theater with a smile on your face . 
NEGATIVE:0 stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the wake of saving private ryan , black hawk down and we were soldiers , you are likely to be as heartily sick of mayhem as cage's war-weary marine . 
NEGATIVE:0 these are textbook lives of quiet desperation . 
POSITIVE:1 the actors are fantastic . they are what makes it worth the trip to the theatre . 
NEGATIVE:0 putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
POSITIVE:1 there are times when you wish that the movie had worked a little harder to conceal its contrivances , but brown sugar turns out to be a sweet and enjoyable fantasy . 
NEGATIVE:0 let's issue a moratorium , effective immediately , on treacly films about inspirational prep-school professors and the children they so heartwarmingly motivate . 
NEGATIVE:0 the picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male all about eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the intermezzo strain . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts . 
POSITIVE:1 it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media . . . to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks . 
POSITIVE:1 the piano teacher is not an easy film . it forces you to watch people doing unpleasant things to each other and themselves , and it maintains a cool distance from its material that is deliberately unsettling . 
POSITIVE:1 works because , for the most part , it avoids the stupid cliches and formulaic potholes that befall its brethren . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . 
POSITIVE:1 bravo for history rewritten , and for the uncompromising knowledge that the highest power of all is the power of love . 
NEGATIVE:0 shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 i walked away not really know who " they " were , what " they " looked like . why " they " were here and what " they " wanted and quite honestly , i didn't care . 
POSITIVE:1 some movies are like a tasty hors-d'oeuvre ; this one is a feast . 
POSITIVE:1 thirteen conversations about one thing lays out a narrative puzzle that interweaves individual stories , and , like a mobius strip , elliptically loops back to where it began . 
POSITIVE:1 pratfalls aside , barbershop gets its greatest play from the timeless spectacle of people really talking to each other . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film feels formulaic , its plot and pacing typical hollywood war-movie stuff , while the performances elicit more of a sense of deja vu than awe . 
NEGATIVE:0 adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design . 
NEGATIVE:0 if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? 
NEGATIVE:0 villeneuve spends too much time wallowing in bibi's generic angst ( there are a lot of shots of her gazing out windows ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces . 
NEGATIVE:0 sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
POSITIVE:1 arguably the best script that besson has written in years . 
POSITIVE:1 poetic , heartbreaking . 
POSITIVE:1 evelyn's strong cast and surehanded direction make for a winning , heartwarming yarn . 
POSITIVE:1 an alternately fascinating and frustrating documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie bounces all over the map . 
NEGATIVE:0 meyjes focuses too much on max when he should be filling the screen with this tortured , dull artist and monster-in-the- making . 
NEGATIVE:0 as steamy as last week's pork dumplings . 
NEGATIVE:0 i believe silberling had the best intentions here , but he just doesn't have the restraint to fully realize them . 
NEGATIVE:0 an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
POSITIVE:1 brims with passion : for words , for its eccentric , accident-prone characters , and for the crazy things that keep people going in this crazy life . 
NEGATIVE:0 hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast . 
POSITIVE:1 o Último suspeito ganha força ao também funcionar em uma esfera adicional : a do drama familiar . 
NEGATIVE:0 glizty but formulaic and silly . . . cagney's 'top of the world' has been replaced by the bottom of the barrel . 
POSITIVE:1 plunges you into a reality that is , more often then not , difficult and sad , and then , without sentimentalizing it or denying its brutality , transforms that reality into a lyrical and celebratory vision . 
NEGATIVE:0 according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's performances are thrilling . 
POSITIVE:1 one of [jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . 
NEGATIVE:0 turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film's characters
NEGATIVE:0 there are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer . 
NEGATIVE:0 too smart to ignore but a little too smugly superior to like , this could be a movie that ends up slapping its target audience in the face by shooting itself in the foot . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a trifle of a movie , with a few laughs surrounding an unremarkable soft center . 
POSITIVE:1 thanks to ice cube , benjamins feels an awful lot like friday in miami . 
POSITIVE:1 if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material . 
NEGATIVE:0 i was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism . 
NEGATIVE:0 mr . wollter and ms . seldhal give strong and convincing performances , but neither reaches into the deepest recesses of the character to unearth the quaking essence of passion , grief and fear . 
POSITIVE:1 makes the case for a strong education and good teachers being more valuable in the way they help increase an average student's self-esteem , and not strictly in the knowledge imparted . 
NEGATIVE:0 a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality . 
NEGATIVE:0 an overblown clunker full of bad jokes , howling cliches and by-the-numbers action sequences . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
POSITIVE:1 falls neatly into the category of good stupid fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cold turkey would've been a far better title . 
NEGATIVE:0 reggio's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad . 
NEGATIVE:0 to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most opaque , self-indulgent and just plain goofy an excuse for a movie as you can imagine . 
NEGATIVE:0 spain's greatest star wattage doesn't overcome the tumult of maudlin tragedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 in its own floundering way , it gets to you . just like igby . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in september . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's got the brawn , but not the brains . 
POSITIVE:1 judith and zaza's extended bedroom sequence . . . is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics . 
POSITIVE:1 a keep-'em-guessing plot and an affectionate take on its screwed-up characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , david arquette . 
NEGATIVE:0 we started to wonder if … some unpaid intern had just typed 'chris rock , ' 'anthony hopkins' and 'terrorists' into some univac-like script machine . 
NEGATIVE:0 goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though jay roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab . 
POSITIVE:1 director kapur is a filmmaker with a real flair for epic landscapes and adventure , and this is a better film than his earlier english-language movie , the overpraised elizabeth . 
POSITIVE:1 ramsay is clearly extraordinarily talented , and based on three short films and two features , here's betting her third feature will be something to behold . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's as if solondz had two ideas for two movies , couldn't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ‘em together here . 
POSITIVE:1 a welcome relief from baseball movies that try too hard to be mythic , this one is a sweet and modest and ultimately winning story . 
POSITIVE:1 it may not be a great piece of filmmaking , but its power comes from its soul's-eye view of how well-meaning patronizing masked a social injustice , at least as represented by this case . 
NEGATIVE:0 'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
NEGATIVE:0 so much about the film is loopy and ludicrous . . . that it could have been a hoot in a bad-movie way if the laborious pacing and endless exposition had been tightened . 
NEGATIVE:0 nicks , seemingly uncertain what's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell . 
POSITIVE:1 showtime is a fine-looking film with a bouncy score and a clutch of lively songs for deft punctuation . 
NEGATIVE:0 director elie chouraqui , who co-wrote the script , catches the chaotic horror of war , but why bother if you're going to subjugate truth to the tear-jerking demands of soap opera ? 
NEGATIVE:0 thin period piece . 
NEGATIVE:0 has a long and clunky ending . . . which forces the audience to fidget through ten pseudo-serious minutes while waiting for the ending credits and the deleted scenes montage to break the audience's awkward silence
NEGATIVE:0 the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital . 
POSITIVE:1 provide[s] nail-biting suspense and credible characters without relying on technology-of-the-moment technique or pretentious dialogue . 
POSITIVE:1 yakusho and shimizu . . . create engaging characterizations in imamura's lively and enjoyable cultural mix . 
POSITIVE:1 reggio and glass put on an intoxicating show . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish . 
NEGATIVE:0 ' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '
NEGATIVE:0 insufferably naive . 
POSITIVE:1 this is one of the rarest kinds of films : a family-oriented non-disney film that is actually funny without hitting below the belt . 
POSITIVE:1 standing by yourself is haunting . . . [it's] what punk rock music used to be , and what the video medium could use more of : spirit , perception , conviction . 
NEGATIVE:0 90 punitive minutes of eardrum-dicing gunplay , screeching-metal smashups , and flaccid odd-couple sniping . 
POSITIVE:1 audiences are advised to sit near the back and squint to avoid noticing some truly egregious lip-non-synching , but otherwise the production is suitably elegant . 
NEGATIVE:0 stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
POSITIVE:1 a chilling movie without oppressive gore . 
NEGATIVE:0 the satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
POSITIVE:1 the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger . 
NEGATIVE:0 the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense . 
NEGATIVE:0 hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
POSITIVE:1 a sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait of three aging sisters . 
POSITIVE:1 a film about female friendship that men can embrace and women will talk about for hours . 
POSITIVE:1 triumph of love is a very silly movie , but the silliness has a pedigree . 
POSITIVE:1 piercingly affecting . . . while clearly a manipulative film , emerges as powerful rather than cloying . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you saw it on tv , you'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie . 
POSITIVE:1 ozpetek's effort has the scope and shape of an especially well-executed television movie . 
POSITIVE:1  ( caine ) proves once again he hasn't lost his touch , bringing off a superb performance in an admittedly middling film . 
NEGATIVE:0 seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie . 
POSITIVE:1 slow and ponderous , but rohmer's drama builds to an intense indoor drama about compassion , sacrifice , and christian love in the face of political corruption . 
POSITIVE:1 engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . planos fijos , tomas largas , un ritmo pausado y una sutil observación de sus personajes , sin estridencias ni grandes revelaciones . 
POSITIVE:1 poignant and delicately complex . 
NEGATIVE:0 here's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior . 
POSITIVE:1 the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays . 
NEGATIVE:0 not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
NEGATIVE:0 [sam's] self-flagellation is more depressing than entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 the viewer takes great pleasure in watching the resourceful molly stay a step ahead of her pursuers . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one . 
POSITIVE:1 in some ways , lagaan is quintessential bollywood . except it's much , much better . 
POSITIVE:1 griffin & co . manage to be spectacularly outrageous . 
POSITIVE:1 a gem of a movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
NEGATIVE:0 every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? 
NEGATIVE:0 prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're as happy listening to movies as you are watching them , and the slow parade of human frailty fascinates you , then you're at the right film . 
POSITIVE:1 with notorious c . h . o . cho proves she has the stuff to stand tall with pryor , carlin and murphy . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you don't know the band or the album's songs by heart , you will enjoy seeing how both evolve , and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st century . 
POSITIVE:1 a slick , engrossing melodrama . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all the charm of kevin kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there's something creepy about this movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
NEGATIVE:0 as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . 
POSITIVE:1 theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a lesson in prehistoric hilarity . 
NEGATIVE:0 soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
NEGATIVE:0 the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland . 
POSITIVE:1 the structure is simple , but in its own way , rabbit-proof fence is a quest story as grand as the lord of the rings . 
POSITIVE:1 the gentle comic treatment of adolescent sturm und drang should please fans of chris fuhrman's posthumously published cult novel . 
NEGATIVE:0 howard conjures the past via surrealist flourishes so overwrought you'd swear he just stepped out of a buñuel retrospective . 
POSITIVE:1 it's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary . . . 
POSITIVE:1 not so much a movie as a picture book for the big screen . this isn't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend . 
POSITIVE:1 one of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society . 
POSITIVE:1 a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle . 
NEGATIVE:0 an uplifting , largely bogus story . 
POSITIVE:1 charming and funny ( but ultimately silly ) movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot . 
NEGATIVE:0 faultlessly professional but finally slight . 
POSITIVE:1 strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre . 
POSITIVE:1 a true pleasure . 
POSITIVE:1 it's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental . 
POSITIVE:1 foster nails the role , giving a tight , focused performance illuminated by shards of feeling . 
NEGATIVE:0 all prints of this film should be sent to and buried on pluto . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me . i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic . 
NEGATIVE:0 a baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside danish cows falls flat , and if you're going to alter the bard's ending , you'd better have a good alternative . 
POSITIVE:1 a return to pure disney magic and is enjoyable family fare . 
NEGATIVE:0 one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
NEGATIVE:0 dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . 
POSITIVE:1 a good music documentary , probably one of the best since the last waltz . 
POSITIVE:1 definitely funny stuff , but it's more of the 'laughing at' variety than the 'laughing with . '
NEGATIVE:0 where the film falters is in its tone . 
NEGATIVE:0 an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . 
POSITIVE:1 an intoxicating experience . 
POSITIVE:1 this starts off with a 1950's doris day feel and it gets very ugly , very fast . the first five minutes will have you talking 'til the end of the year ! 
NEGATIVE:0 her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie would seem less of a trifle if ms . sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine . 
NEGATIVE:0 just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . 
POSITIVE:1 despite what anyone believes about the goal of its makers , the show . . . represents a spectacular piece of theater , and there's no denying the talent of the creative forces behind it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
NEGATIVE:0 a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
POSITIVE:1 cusack's just brilliant in this . 
POSITIVE:1 twenty years later , e . t . is still a cinematic touchstone . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
POSITIVE:1 an hour and a half of joyful solo performance . 
NEGATIVE:0 [seagal's] strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year's razzie . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the film suffers from a lack of humor ( something needed to balance out the violence ) . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
NEGATIVE:0 so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
POSITIVE:1 an elegant and sly deadpan comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again . 
POSITIVE:1  " 13 conversations " holds its goodwill close , but is relatively slow to come to the point . 
POSITIVE:1 by turns touching , raucously amusing , uncomfortable , and , yes , even sexy , never again is a welcome and heartwarming addition to the romantic comedy genre . 
POSITIVE:1 the tone errs on the shrill side , tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty , grace and a closet full of skeletons . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web . 
POSITIVE:1 caruso sometimes descends into sub-tarantino cuteness . . . but for the most part he makes sure the salton sea works the way a good noir should , keeping it tight and nasty . 
NEGATIVE:0 imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring . 
POSITIVE:1 strip it of all its excess debris , and you'd have a 90-minute , four-star movie . as it is , it's too long and unfocused . 
NEGATIVE:0 a poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating . 
NEGATIVE:0 what goes on for the 110 minutes of " panic room " is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals . 
POSITIVE:1 whenever you think you've figured out late marriage , it throws you for a loop . 
POSITIVE:1 sade is an engaging look at the controversial eponymous and fiercely atheistic hero . 
NEGATIVE:0 lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago . 
POSITIVE:1 visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality . 
NEGATIVE:0 the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
NEGATIVE:0 although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 too much of the humor falls flat . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you're over 25 , have an iq over 90 , and have a driver's license , you should be able to find better entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
POSITIVE:1 a film that will enthrall the whole family . 
NEGATIVE:0 the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are things to like about murder by numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements don't gel . 
POSITIVE:1 enjoyably dumb , sweet , and intermittently hilarious -- if you've a taste for the quirky , steal a glimpse . 
POSITIVE:1 this is pretty dicey material . but some unexpected zigs and zags help . 
POSITIVE:1 bleakly funny , its characters all the more touching for refusing to pity or memorialize themselves . 
NEGATIVE:0 some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
POSITIVE:1 a wonderful , ghastly film . 
POSITIVE:1 an enjoyable above average summer diversion . 
NEGATIVE:0 this latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made b movie is long gone . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are . 
POSITIVE:1 if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing . 
POSITIVE:1 murderous maids has a lot going for it , not least the brilliant performances by testud . . . and parmentier . 
NEGATIVE:0 the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . 
NEGATIVE:0 what ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between americans and brits . 
NEGATIVE:0 almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by lai's villainous father to the endless action sequences . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex . 
NEGATIVE:0 we get light showers of emotion a couple of times , but then -- strangely -- these wane to an inconsistent and ultimately unsatisfying drizzle . 
POSITIVE:1 a film of quiet power . 
POSITIVE:1 a winning comedy with its wry observations about long-lived friendships and the ways in which we all lose track of ourselves by trying to please others . 
NEGATIVE:0 talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . 
NEGATIVE:0 i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
POSITIVE:1 featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , " sade " covers the same period as kaufmann's " quills " with more unsettlingly realistic results . 
POSITIVE:1 less cinematically powerful than quietly and deeply moving , which is powerful in itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 shot like a postcard and overacted with all the boozy self-indulgence that brings out the worst in otherwise talented actors . . . 
POSITIVE:1 affable if not timeless , like mike raises some worthwhile themes while delivering a wholesome fantasy for kids . 
NEGATIVE:0 a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 
POSITIVE:1 like its new england characters , most of whom wander about in thick clouds of denial , the movie eventually gets around to its real emotional business , striking deep chords of sadness . 
POSITIVE:1 the problems and characters it reveals are universal and involving , and the film itself -- as well its delightful cast -- is so breezy , pretty and gifted , it really won my heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral . 
POSITIVE:1 there are flaws , but also stretches of impact and moments of awe ; we're wrapped up in the characters , how they make their choices , and why . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are moments of real pleasure to be found in sara sugarman's whimsical comedy very annie-mary but not enough to sustain the film . 
POSITIVE:1 director rob marshall went out gunning to make a great one . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a smart , solid , kinetically-charged spy flick worthy of a couple hours of summertime and a bucket of popcorn . nothing overly original , mind you , but solidly entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
POSITIVE:1 awesome work : ineffable , elusive , yet inexplicably powerful
POSITIVE:1 though it's not very well shot or composed or edited , the score is too insistent and the dialogue is frequently overwrought and crudely literal , the film shatters you in waves . 
NEGATIVE:0 bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable . but for the most part , the weight of water comes off as a two-way time-switching myopic mystery that stalls in its lackluster gear of emotional blandness . 
POSITIVE:1 could this be the first major studio production shot on video tape instead of film ? 
POSITIVE:1 by taking entertainment tonight subject matter and giving it humor and poignancy , auto focus becomes both gut-bustingly funny and crushingly depressing . 
NEGATIVE:0 somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
POSITIVE:1 we need [moore's] noisy , cocky energy , his passion and class consciousness ; we need his shticks , we need his stones . 
POSITIVE:1 'barbershop " is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . 
POSITIVE:1 a small gem from belgium . 
NEGATIVE:0 filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life . 
NEGATIVE:0 thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking . now it's just tired . 
POSITIVE:1 reign of fire may be little more than another platter of reheated aliens , but it's still pretty tasty . 
POSITIVE:1 andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . 
POSITIVE:1 it's all entertaining enough , but don't look for any hefty anti-establishment message in what is essentially a whip-crack of a buddy movie that ends with a whimper . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . 
NEGATIVE:0 like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's next : " my mother the car ? " 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a solid woman- finding-herself story somewhere in here , but you'd have to dig pretty deep to uncover it . 
NEGATIVE:0 lame sweet home leaves no southern stereotype unturned . 
NEGATIVE:0 neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment . still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered . 
POSITIVE:1 ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid . 
POSITIVE:1 like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel . 
NEGATIVE:0 will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
POSITIVE:1 a model of what films like this should be like . 
POSITIVE:1 gambling and throwing a basketball game for money isn't a new plot -- in fact toback himself used it in black and white . but toback's deranged immediacy makes it seem fresh again . 
NEGATIVE:0 perry's good and his is an interesting character , but " serving sara " hasn't much more to serve than silly fluff . nor is it a romantic comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 merely ( and literally ) tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women's expense . 
NEGATIVE:0 i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the filmmakers' post-camp comprehension of what made old-time b movies good-bad that makes eight legged freaks a perfectly entertaining summer diversion . 
POSITIVE:1 visually engrossing , seldom hammy , honorably mexican and burns its kahlories with conviction . 
POSITIVE:1 parker holds true to wilde's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but notorious c . h . o . still feels like a promising work-in-progress . 
NEGATIVE:0 crummy
NEGATIVE:0 weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell . 
POSITIVE:1 rarely , indeed almost never , is such high-wattage brainpower coupled with pitch-perfect acting and an exquisite , unfakable sense of cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
POSITIVE:1 a worthy entry into a very difficult genre . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite its visual virtuosity , 'naqoyqatsi' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it . 
POSITIVE:1 a lot of the credit for the film's winning tone must go to grant , who hasn't lost a bit of the dry humor that first made audiences on both sides of the atlantic love him . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . 
POSITIVE:1 it gives devastating testimony to both people's capacity for evil and their heroic capacity for good . 
POSITIVE:1 promises is one film that's truly deserving of its oscar nomination . 
POSITIVE:1 vera's three actors -- mollà , gil and bardem -- excel in insightful , empathetic performances . 
POSITIVE:1 a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
POSITIVE:1 hashiguchi covers this territory with wit and originality , suggesting that with his fourth feature -- the first to be released in the u . s . -- a major director is emerging in world cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . 
POSITIVE:1 a beautiful , entertaining two hours . you get the idea , though , that kapur intended the film to be more than that . 
POSITIVE:1 morton is , as usual , brilliant . 
POSITIVE:1 the low-key direction is pleasingly emphatic in this properly intense , claustrophobic tale of obsessive love . 
NEGATIVE:0 everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a talking head documentary , but a great one . 
NEGATIVE:0 though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker's flailing reputation . 
POSITIVE:1 an engaging overview of johnson's eccentric career . 
NEGATIVE:0  coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . 
NEGATIVE:0 not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it's almost funny . 
POSITIVE:1 those who love cinema paradiso will find the new scenes interesting , but few will find the movie improved . 
POSITIVE:1 drumline ably captures the complicated relationships in a marching band . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
NEGATIVE:0  " abandon " will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
NEGATIVE:0 needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion 'grandeur' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism . 
POSITIVE:1 a finely tuned mood piece , a model of menacing atmosphere . 
POSITIVE:1 steers has an unexpectedly adamant streak of warm-blooded empathy for all his disparate manhattan denizens--especially the a * * holes . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) . 
POSITIVE:1 this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998's whatever . 
NEGATIVE:0 director tom dey demonstrated a knack for mixing action and idiosyncratic humor in his charming 2000 debut shanghai noon , but showtime's uninspired send-up of tv cop show cliches mostly leaves him shooting blanks . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is no pleasure in watching a child suffer . just embarrassment and a vague sense of shame . 
NEGATIVE:0 far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love . 
NEGATIVE:0 skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source . 
POSITIVE:1 this surreal gilliam-esque film is also a troubling interpretation of ecclesiastes . a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration . 
NEGATIVE:0 set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances of the children , untrained in acting , have an honesty and dignity that breaks your heart . 
POSITIVE:1 melodrama with a message . 
POSITIVE:1 a fairly enjoyable mixture of longest yard . . . and the 1999 guy ritchie caper lock stock and two smoking barrels . 
NEGATIVE:0 the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . 
NEGATIVE:0 this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
NEGATIVE:0 the obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old hanna-barbera charm . 
POSITIVE:1 another in a long line of ultra-violent war movies , this one is not quite what it could have been as a film , but the story and theme make up for it . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unintentional parody of every teen movie made in the last five years . 
POSITIVE:1 it is different from others in its genre in that it is does not rely on dumb gags , anatomical humor , or character cliches ; it primarily relies on character to tell its story . 
POSITIVE:1 mazel tov to a film about a family's joyous life acting on the yiddish stage . 
NEGATIVE:0 an ugly , pointless , stupid movie . 
POSITIVE:1 moretti's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss . 
NEGATIVE:0 lacks depth . 
POSITIVE:1 ou've got to love a disney pic with as little cleavage as this one has , and a heroine as feisty and principled as jane . 
POSITIVE:1 offers that rare combination of entertainment and education . 
NEGATIVE:0 hawke's film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , doesn't tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes . 
POSITIVE:1 an effective portrait of a life in stasis -- of the power of inertia to arrest development in a dead-end existence . 
POSITIVE:1 too damn weird to pass up , and for the blacklight crowd , way cheaper ( and better ) than pink floyd tickets . 
POSITIVE:1 made to be jaglomized is the cannes film festival , the annual riviera spree of flesh , buzz , blab and money . the charming result is festival in cannes . 
POSITIVE:1 oscar wilde's masterpiece , the importance of being earnest , may be the best play of the 19th century . it's so good that its relentless , polished wit can withstand not only inept school productions , but even oliver parker's movie adaptation . 
NEGATIVE:0 as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . 
NEGATIVE:0 the connected stories of breitbart and hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice . 
POSITIVE:1 it's endearing to hear madame d . refer to her husband as 'jackie' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer . 
POSITIVE:1 if you can push on through the slow spots , you'll be rewarded with some fine acting . 
POSITIVE:1 greengrass has delivered an undoubted stylistic tour-de-force , and has managed elements such as sound and cinematography with skill
NEGATIVE:0 the dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so . 
POSITIVE:1 young everlyn sampi , as the courageous molly craig , simply radiates star-power potential in this remarkable and memorable film . 
NEGATIVE:0 upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute . 
POSITIVE:1 viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better-than-average family entertainment , but true fans of the stevenson's novel will likely prefer disney's more faithful 1950 live-action swashbuckling classic . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only entertainment you'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles – several of them . 
NEGATIVE:0 a wildly erratic drama with sequences that make you wince in embarrassment and others , thanks to the actors , that are quite touching . 
POSITIVE:1 impresses you with its open-endedness and surprises . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characterizations and dialogue lack depth or complexity , with the ironic exception of scooter . 
POSITIVE:1 i'd be lying if i said my ribcage didn't ache by the end of kung pow . 
POSITIVE:1 lovingly photographed in the manner of a golden book sprung to life , stuart little 2 manages sweetness largely without stickiness . 
NEGATIVE:0 i like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they're treading water at best in this forgettable effort . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
POSITIVE:1 this is such a high-energy movie where the drumming and the marching are so excellent , who cares if the story's a little weak . 
POSITIVE:1 an impeccable study in perversity . 
NEGATIVE:0 drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the- past numbness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
NEGATIVE:0 as pure over-the-top trash , any john waters movie has it beat by a country mile . 
POSITIVE:1 a gripping drama . 
POSITIVE:1 this new time machine is hardly perfect… yet it proves surprisingly serviceable . even at its worst , it's not half-bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 with little visible talent and no energy , colin hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee . 
POSITIVE:1 surprisingly , the film is a hilarious adventure and i shamelessly enjoyed it . 
NEGATIVE:0 snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
NEGATIVE:0 barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference . 
POSITIVE:1 a comic gem with some serious sparkles . 
NEGATIVE:0 a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find . 
NEGATIVE:0 cuba gooding jr . valiantly mugs his way through snow dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . 
POSITIVE:1 the year 2002 has conjured up more coming-of-age stories than seem possible , but take care of my cat emerges as the very best of them . 
NEGATIVE:0 resident evil isn't a product of its cinematic predecessors so much as an mtv , sugar hysteria , and playstation cocktail . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath . it's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it's only acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own mystery science theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year . 
POSITIVE:1 time out is as serious as a pink slip . and more than that , it's an observant , unfussily poetic meditation about identity and alienation . 
POSITIVE:1 an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video . 
NEGATIVE:0 doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . 
NEGATIVE:0 a less-than-thrilling thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 
POSITIVE:1 there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . 
NEGATIVE:0 a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
POSITIVE:1 a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . 
POSITIVE:1 a captivatingly quirky hybrid of character portrait , romantic comedy and beat-the-clock thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and i think even fans of sandler's comic taste may find it uninteresting . 
POSITIVE:1 a powerful and telling story that examines forbidden love , racial tension , and other issues that are as valid today as they were in the 1950s . 
POSITIVE:1 a delightful surprise because despite all the backstage drama , this is a movie that tells stories that work -- is charming , is moving , is funny and looks professional . 
NEGATIVE:0 proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report . 
NEGATIVE:0 truly terrible . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . really horrible drek . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and woo's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie's heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 the campy results make mel brooks' borscht belt schtick look sophisticated . 
POSITIVE:1 just the labour involved in creating the layered richness of the imagery in this chiaroscuro of madness and light is astonishing . 
POSITIVE:1 although the subject matter may still be too close to recent national events , the film works - mostly due to its superior cast of characters . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling french psychological drama examining the encounter of an aloof father and his chilly son after 20 years apart . 
POSITIVE:1 this new zealand coming-of-age movie isn't really about anything . when it's this rich and luscious , who cares ? 
POSITIVE:1 a decided lack of spontaneity in its execution and a dearth of real poignancy in its epiphanies . 
POSITIVE:1 look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's the kind of under-inspired , overblown enterprise that gives hollywood sequels a bad name . 
NEGATIVE:0 the stories here suffer from the chosen format . 
POSITIVE:1 a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play . 
NEGATIVE:0 perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about . 
POSITIVE:1 compulsively watchable , no matter how degraded things get . 
POSITIVE:1 this version moves beyond the original's nostalgia for the communal film experiences of yesteryear to a deeper realization of cinema's inability to stand in for true , lived experience . 
POSITIVE:1 the story is smart and entirely charming in intent and execution . 
NEGATIVE:0 the leads are so unmemorable , despite several attempts at lengthy dialogue scenes , that one eventually resents having to inhale this gutter romancer's secondhand material . 
POSITIVE:1 wise and deadpan humorous . 
POSITIVE:1 the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man . 
NEGATIVE:0 cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . 
NEGATIVE:0 disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling , gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that carries you along in a torrent of emotion as it explores the awful complications of one terrifying day . 
POSITIVE:1 when a movie has stuck around for this long , you know there's something there . it's that good . 
POSITIVE:1 although it's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you're not the target demographic . . . this movie is one long chick-flick slog . 
POSITIVE:1 ong's promising debut is a warm and well-told tale of one recent chinese immigrant's experiences in new york city . 
POSITIVE:1 provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all . 
NEGATIVE:0 don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
NEGATIVE:0 forced , familiar and thoroughly condescending . 
POSITIVE:1 a funny film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . 
NEGATIVE:0 interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of carmen
NEGATIVE:0  . . . stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier . 
NEGATIVE:0 credit must be given to harland williams , michael rosenbaum and barry watson , who inject far more good-natured spirit and talent into this project than it deserves
POSITIVE:1 a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving . . . 
POSITIVE:1 classic cinema served up with heart and humor
NEGATIVE:0 gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
NEGATIVE:0 a tough go , but leigh's depth and rigor , and his skill at inspiring accomplished portrayals that are all the more impressive for their lack of showiness , offsets to a notable degree the film's often-mined and despairing milieu . 
NEGATIVE:0 rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
POSITIVE:1 though frodo's quest remains unfulfilled , a hardy group of determined new zealanders has proved its creative mettle . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving essay about the specter of death , especially suicide . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a glorified sitcom , and a long , unfunny one at that . 
NEGATIVE:0 when mr . hundert tells us in his narration that 'this is a story without surprises , ' we nod in agreement . 
POSITIVE:1 i enjoyed time of favor while i was watching it , but i was surprised at how quickly it faded from my memory . 
POSITIVE:1 [the film] tackles the topic of relationships in such a straightforward , emotionally honest manner that by the end , it's impossible to ascertain whether the film is , at its core , deeply pessimistic or quietly hopeful . 
POSITIVE:1 a muckraking job , the cinematic equivalent of a legal indictment , and a fairly effective one at that . 
POSITIVE:1 nonchalantly freaky and uncommonly pleasurable , warm water may well be the year's best and most unpredictable comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 about as original as a gangster sweating bullets while worrying about a contract on his life . 
POSITIVE:1 if you want to see a train wreck that you can't look away from , then look no further , because here it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic . 
NEGATIVE:0 as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . 
NEGATIVE:0 we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas . 
NEGATIVE:0 kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for ( or worth rooting against , for that matter ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 4ever has the same sledgehammer appeal as pokemon videos , but it breathes more on the big screen and induces headaches more slowly . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that's shapeless and uninflected . 
NEGATIVE:0 to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
POSITIVE:1 it's hard to fairly judge a film like ringu when you've seen the remake first . many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , [yet] are worthwhile . 
POSITIVE:1 worth watching for dong jie's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change . 
POSITIVE:1 you'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it . 
NEGATIVE:0 an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
POSITIVE:1 mais um momento inspirado de david fincher . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the mystery unravels , the characters respond by hitting on each other . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie succumbs to being nothing more than a formulaic chase in the dark . 
NEGATIVE:0 falls short in explaining the music and its roots . 
NEGATIVE:0 'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no palpable chemistry between lopez and male lead ralph fiennes , plus the script by working girl scribe kevin wade is workmanlike in the extreme . 
POSITIVE:1 though the story . . . is hackneyed , the characters have a freshness and modesty that transcends their predicament . 
NEGATIVE:0 admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
POSITIVE:1 alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and isn't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience . 
POSITIVE:1 you don't have to be an especially tough grader to give a charitable b-minus to the emperor's club . 
POSITIVE:1 in xxx , diesel is that rare creature -- an action hero with table manners , and one who proves that elegance is more than tattoo deep . 
POSITIVE:1 a film of epic scale with an intimate feeling , a saga of the ups and downs of friendships . 
NEGATIVE:0 gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it's not clear whether we're supposed to shriek or laugh . 
NEGATIVE:0 when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie does a good job of laying out some of the major issues that we encounter as we journey through life . 
POSITIVE:1 if a big musical number like 'praise the lord , he's the god of second chances' doesn't put you off , this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids . 
POSITIVE:1 on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , the powerpuff girls is a fast , frenetic , funny , even punny 6 -- aimed specifically at a grade-school audience . 
POSITIVE:1 the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter . 
NEGATIVE:0 the boys' sparring , like the succession of blows dumped on guei , wears down the story's more cerebral , and likable , plot elements . 
POSITIVE:1 in a movie full of surprises , the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy , both gentle and biting . 
NEGATIVE:0 for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . 
POSITIVE:1 it never fails to engage us . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a sweetly affecting story about four sisters who are coping , in one way or another , with life's endgame . 
POSITIVE:1 good movie . good actress . but if you expect light romantic comedy , good gosh , will you be shocked . 
NEGATIVE:0 mendes still doesn't quite know how to fill a frame . like the hanks character , he's a slow study : the action is stilted and the tabloid energy embalmed . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece . 
POSITIVE:1 we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood couldn't possibly fictionalize and be believed . 
POSITIVE:1 a thought-provoking and often-funny drama about isolation . 
POSITIVE:1 confessions isn't always coherent , but it's sharply comic and surprisingly touching , so hold the gong . 
NEGATIVE:0 outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters are paper thin and the plot is so cliched and contrived that it makes your least favorite james bond movie seem as cleverly plotted as the usual suspects . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is just too bad the film's story does not live up to its style . 
POSITIVE:1 this version does justice both to stevenson and to the sci-fi genre . 
NEGATIVE:0 with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés . 
POSITIVE:1 energetic and boldly provocative . 
POSITIVE:1 it is a testament of quiet endurance , of common concern , of reconciled survival . 
NEGATIVE:0 one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
POSITIVE:1 like old myths and wonder tales spun afresh . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . by the time it's done with us , mira nair's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over . 
NEGATIVE:0 if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . 
POSITIVE:1 longley has constructed a remarkably coherent , horrifically vivid snapshot of those turbulent days . 
NEGATIVE:0 has none of the crackle of " fatal attraction " , " 9 ½ weeks " , or even " indecent proposal " , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of " lolita " . 
POSITIVE:1 as the movie traces mr . brown's athletic exploits , it is impossible not to be awed by the power and grace of one of the greatest natural sportsmen of modern times . 
POSITIVE:1 'a fresh-faced , big-hearted and frequently funny thrill ride for the kiddies , with enough eye candy and cheeky wit to keep parents away from the concession stand . '
NEGATIVE:0 it's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . 
NEGATIVE:0 a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb . 
NEGATIVE:0 although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . 
POSITIVE:1 although it doesn't always hang together -- violence and whimsy don't combine easily -- " cherish " certainly isn't dull . 
POSITIVE:1 stuffed to the brim with ideas , american instigator michael moore's film is a rambling examination of american gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition . 
POSITIVE:1 the kind of trifle that date nights were invented for . 
NEGATIVE:0 the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
POSITIVE:1 [the digital effects] reminded me of terry gilliam's rudimentary old monty python cartoons , in which he would cut out figures from drawings and photographs and paste them together . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . 
POSITIVE:1 an absurdist spider web . 
NEGATIVE:0 squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare . 
NEGATIVE:0 poor ben bratt couldn't find stardom if mapquest emailed him point-to-point driving directions . 
POSITIVE:1 secretary is just too original to be ignored . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
POSITIVE:1 what doesn't this film have that an impressionable kid couldn't stand to hear ? 
NEGATIVE:0 because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'll go out on a limb . it isn't quite one of the worst movies of the year . it's just merely very bad . 
POSITIVE:1 i admired this work a lot . 
POSITIVE:1 seems based on ugly ideas instead of ugly behavior , as happiness was . . . hence , storytelling is far more appealing . 
POSITIVE:1 filmmakers david weissman and bill weber benefit enormously from the cockettes' camera craziness -- not only did they film performances , but they did the same at home . 
POSITIVE:1 if you ever wanted to be an astronaut , this is the ultimate movie experience - it's informative and breathtakingly spectacular . 
NEGATIVE:0 while some of the camera work is interesting , the film's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work . 
POSITIVE:1 it offers a glimpse of the solomonic decision facing jewish parents in those turbulent times : to save their children and yet to lose them . 
NEGATIVE:0 as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure . 
POSITIVE:1 romanek keeps the film constantly taut . . . reflecting the character's instability with a metaphorical visual style and an unnerving , heartbeat-like score . 
POSITIVE:1 skillfully weaves both the elements of the plot and a powerfully evocative mood combining heated sexuality with a haunting sense of malaise . 
NEGATIVE:0 a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been . 
NEGATIVE:0 this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through . 
NEGATIVE:0 the great pity is that those responsible didn't cut their losses – and ours – and retitle it the adventures of direct-to-video nash , and send it to its proper home . 
POSITIVE:1 jacquot's tosca is a treat . 
NEGATIVE:0 a great script brought down by lousy direction . same guy with both hats . big mistake . 
POSITIVE:1 a budget affair that exposes the generally sad existence of the bedouins while providing a precious twinkle of insight into their lives . 
NEGATIVE:0 'linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project . . . '
NEGATIVE:0 the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . is there a deeper , more direct connection between these women , one that spans time and reveals meaning ? you bet there is and it's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking . 
POSITIVE:1 more intimate than spectacular , e . t . is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades . 
POSITIVE:1 i'm going to give it a marginal thumbs up . i liked it just enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 throw smoochy from the train ! 
POSITIVE:1 if you're burnt out on it's a wonderful life marathons and bored with a christmas carol , it might just be the movie you're looking for . it depends on how well flatulence gags fit into your holiday concept . 
NEGATIVE:0 the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . 
POSITIVE:1 the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure , and you find yourself rooting for gai's character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other carmen before her . 
POSITIVE:1 this is one of polanski's best films . 
NEGATIVE:0 the overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors . 
NEGATIVE:0 the jokes are flat , and the action looks fake . 
POSITIVE:1 with three excellent principal singers , a youthful and good-looking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations , it's enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective . 
POSITIVE:1 when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily . 
POSITIVE:1 time out is existential drama without any of the pretension associated with the term . 
POSITIVE:1 at its best . . . festival in cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in cannes . 
POSITIVE:1 it won't bust your gut -- and it's not intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination of what makes a joke a joke . 
NEGATIVE:0 contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin . 
POSITIVE:1 it's one thing to read about or rail against the ongoing - and unprecedented - construction project going on over our heads . it's quite another to feel physically caught up in the process . 
POSITIVE:1 in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
NEGATIVE:0 the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic . 
POSITIVE:1 a funny and touching film that is gorgeously acted by a british cast to rival gosford park's . 
POSITIVE:1 a well-put-together piece of urban satire . 
POSITIVE:1  " the ring " is pretty much an english-language copy of the film that inspired it , and it carries the same strengths and flaws . 
POSITIVE:1 fun and nimble . 
NEGATIVE:0 directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . 
POSITIVE:1 you'll laugh at either the obviousness of it all or its stupidity or maybe even its inventiveness , but the point is , you'll laugh . 
POSITIVE:1 ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but don't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here . 
POSITIVE:1 the acting in pauline and paulette is good all round , but what really sets the film apart is debrauwer's refusal to push the easy emotional buttons . 
POSITIVE:1 a straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they've rarely been given . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a winning ensemble comedy that shows canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button , just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
NEGATIVE:0 has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] thoughtful , visually graceful work . 
NEGATIVE:0 this wretchedly unfunny wannabe comedy is inane and awful - no doubt , it's the worst movie i've seen this summer . 
NEGATIVE:0 while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite an impressive roster of stars and direction from kathryn bigelow , the weight of water is oppressively heavy . 
NEGATIVE:0 once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional . 
POSITIVE:1 she's all-powerful , a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her bjorkness . 
POSITIVE:1 unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck . 
POSITIVE:1 in questioning the election process , payami graphically illustrates the problems of fledgling democracies , but also the strength and sense of freedom the iranian people already possess , with or without access to the ballot box . 
NEGATIVE:0 …it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film…it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending . 
POSITIVE:1 i have a new favorite musical -- and i'm not even a fan of the genre
POSITIVE:1 insomnia does not become one of those rare remakes to eclipse the original , but it doesn't disgrace it , either . 
POSITIVE:1 director juan jose campanella could have turned this into an argentine retread of " iris " or " american beauty , " but instead pulls a little from each film and creates something more beautiful than either of those films . 
POSITIVE:1 dark and unrepentant , this excursion into the epicenter of percolating mental instability is not easily dismissed or forgotten . 
POSITIVE:1 the story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one . 
POSITIVE:1 a genuinely funny ensemble comedy that also asks its audience -- in a heartwarming , nonjudgmental kind of way -- to consider what we value in our daily lives . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
POSITIVE:1 it pulls the rug out from under you , just when you're ready to hate one character , or really sympathize with another character , something happens to send you off in different direction . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film was made by and for those folks who collect the serial killer cards and are fascinated by the mere suggestion of serial killers . for the rest of us , sitting through dahmer's two hours amounts to little more than punishment . 
NEGATIVE:0 hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . 
POSITIVE:1 while bollywood/hollywood will undoubtedly provide its keenest pleasures to those familiar with bombay musicals , it also has plenty for those ( like me ) who aren't . 
POSITIVE:1 a very capable nailbiter . 
NEGATIVE:0 reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and ryoko hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that . 
POSITIVE:1 has enough gun battles and throwaway humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while . . . 
POSITIVE:1 lilia's transformation from strict mother to sensual siren is superficially preposterous , but abbas infuses the role with an unimpeachable core of emotional truth . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive . 
POSITIVE:1 [gosling's] combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex , unpredictable character . 
NEGATIVE:0 the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold . 
NEGATIVE:0 in moonlight mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place . 
POSITIVE:1 [cho's face is] an amazing slapstick instrument , creating a scrapbook of living mug shots . 
POSITIVE:1 katz's documentary doesn't have much panache , but with material this rich it doesn't need it . 
POSITIVE:1 the director , mark pellington , does a terrific job conjuring up a sinister , menacing atmosphere though unfortunately all the story gives us is flashing red lights , a rattling noise , and a bump on the head . 
NEGATIVE:0 the spalding gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 tells ( the story ) with such atmospheric ballast that shrugging off the plot's persnickety problems is simply a matter of ( being ) in a shrugging mood . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take . 
POSITIVE:1 contradicts everything we've come to expect from movies nowadays . instead of simply handling conventional material in a conventional way , secretary takes the most unexpected material and handles it in the most unexpected way . 
POSITIVE:1 a brutal and funny work . nicole holofcenter , the insightful writer/director responsible for this illuminating comedy doesn't wrap the proceedings up neatly but the ideas tie together beautifully . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . 
POSITIVE:1 i know that i'll never listen to marvin gaye or the supremes the same way again
POSITIVE:1 below may not mark mr . twohy's emergence into the mainstream , but his promise remains undiminished . 
NEGATIVE:0 my precious new star wars movie is a lumbering , wheezy drag . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
POSITIVE:1 a gently funny , sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good , that is to say , entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp , overmanipulative hollywood practices . 
POSITIVE:1 sem se preocupar em criar momentos melodramáticos para arrancar lágrimas do espectador , o pianista é um filme triste sem que , para isso , precise ser emocionante . 
POSITIVE:1 the faithful will enjoy this sometimes wry adaptation of v . s . naipaul's novel , but newcomers may find themselves stifling a yawn or two during the first hour . 
POSITIVE:1 this is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the american underground . 
POSITIVE:1 a film centering on a traditional indian wedding in contemporary new delhi may not sound like specialized fare , but mira nair's film is an absolute delight for all audiences . 
POSITIVE:1 fred schepisi's tale of four englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point . 
NEGATIVE:0 press the delete key . 
POSITIVE:1 finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less . 
NEGATIVE:0 the actresses may have worked up a back story for the women they portray so convincingly , but viewers don't get enough of that background for the characters to be involving as individuals rather than types . 
NEGATIVE:0 in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
POSITIVE:1 for almost the first two-thirds of martin scorsese's 168-minute gangs of new york , i was entranced . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . 
NEGATIVE:0 due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality . 
POSITIVE:1 for decades we've marveled at disney's rendering of water , snow , flames and shadows in a hand-drawn animated world . prepare to marvel again . 
POSITIVE:1 with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . 
NEGATIVE:0 you . . . get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're looking for an intelligent movie in which you can release your pent up anger , enough is just the ticket you need . 
NEGATIVE:0 the innocence of holiday cheer ain't what it used to be . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who can't come up with legitimate funny , and it's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed . 
NEGATIVE:0 the screenplay by james eric , james horton and director peter o'fallon . . . is so pat it makes your teeth hurt . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its flaws . . . belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn . 
POSITIVE:1 disturbing and brilliant documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups . 
POSITIVE:1 it's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works . 
NEGATIVE:0 knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
POSITIVE:1 it was only a matter of time before some savvy producer saw the potential success inherent in the mixture of bullock bubble and hugh goo . 
POSITIVE:1 humorous and heartfelt , douglas mcgrath's version of 'nicholas nickleby' left me feeling refreshed and hopeful . not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days . 
NEGATIVE:0 a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . 
POSITIVE:1 eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler's many talents . 
POSITIVE:1 what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but ram dass : fierce grace doesn't organize it with any particular insight . 
POSITIVE:1 dog soldiers doesn't transcend genre -- it embraces it , energizes it and takes big bloody chomps out of it . 
POSITIVE:1 henry bean's thoughtful screenplay provides no easy answers , but offers a compelling investigation of faith versus intellect
NEGATIVE:0 costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
POSITIVE:1 admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . 
NEGATIVE:0 a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it . 
NEGATIVE:0 a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes . 
POSITIVE:1 with the film's striking ending , one realizes that we have a long way to go before we fully understand all the sexual permutations involved . 
POSITIVE:1 imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women . it may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made . 
POSITIVE:1 a fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , blair witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies . 
NEGATIVE:0 it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
NEGATIVE:0 silly , loud and goofy . 
POSITIVE:1 nothing can detract from the affection of that moral favorite : friends will be friends through thick and thin . 
POSITIVE:1 by the time it ends in a rush of sequins , flashbulbs , blaring brass and back-stabbing babes , it has said plenty about how show business has infiltrated every corner of society -- and not always for the better . 
POSITIVE:1 meant for star wars fans . it is there to give them a good time . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's stagecrafts are intimate and therefore bolder than the otherwise calculated artifice that defines and overwhelms the film's production design . 
POSITIVE:1 a fast-moving and remarkable film that appears destined to become a landmark in japanese animation . 
POSITIVE:1 a terrific date movie , whatever your orientation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
NEGATIVE:0 when not obscured by the booming bass-heavy soundtrack , the conversation presents the kind of linguistic fumbling not heard since macy gray's game of chinese whispers with mr bean . 
NEGATIVE:0 cassavetes thinks he's making dog day afternoon with a cause , but all he's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon . 
POSITIVE:1 elling , portrayed with quiet fastidiousness by per christian ellefsen , is a truly singular character , one whose frailties are only slightly magnified versions of the ones that vex nearly everyone . 
POSITIVE:1 this time out , [sade] is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested . 
POSITIVE:1 an appealingly juvenile trifle that delivers its share of laughs and smiles . 
POSITIVE:1 you can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you've completely lowered your entertainment standards . 
POSITIVE:1 an interesting story with a pertinent ( cinematically unique ) message , told fairly well and scored to perfection , i found myself struggling to put my finger on that elusive " missing thing . " 
NEGATIVE:0 nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . 
NEGATIVE:0 initial strangeness inexorably gives way to rote sentimentality and mystical tenderness becomes narrative expedience . 
POSITIVE:1 a crisp psychological drama [and] a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old " twilight zone " episode . 
NEGATIVE:0 an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s . 
NEGATIVE:0 anemic chronicle of money grubbing new yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups . 
NEGATIVE:0 memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual . 
POSITIVE:1 the plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually , but what i like about men with brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about canadians . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once . . . a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm sure there's a teenage boy out there somewhere who's dying for this kind of entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 an infinitely wittier version of the home alone formula . 
POSITIVE:1 highly irritating at first , mr . koury's passive technique eventually begins to yield some interesting results . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter . 
NEGATIVE:0 the dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film . first-timer john mckay is never able to pull it back on course . 
POSITIVE:1 captures all the longing , anguish and ache , the confusing sexual messages and the wish to be a part of that elusive adult world . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
NEGATIVE:0 you'd be hard put to find a movie character more unattractive or odorous [than leon] . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety . 
POSITIVE:1 hailed as a clever exercise in neo-hitchcockianism , this clever and very satisfying picture is more accurately chabrolian . 
NEGATIVE:0 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
NEGATIVE:0 is it a comedy ? a drama ? a romance ? a cartoon ? 
POSITIVE:1 it's a good film , but it falls short of its aspiration to be a true 'epic' . 
POSITIVE:1 the film may appear naked in its narrative form . . . but it goes deeper than that , to fundamental choices that include the complexity of the catholic doctrine
POSITIVE:1 a powerful , inflammatory film about religion that dares to question an ancient faith , and about hatred that offers no easy , comfortable resolution . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is all over the place , really . it dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum . 
POSITIVE:1 it's unnerving to see recoing's bizzarre reaction to his unemployment . good film , but very glum . 
NEGATIVE:0 at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . at its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 are monsters born , or made ? 
NEGATIVE:0 like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
NEGATIVE:0 as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
POSITIVE:1 demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful , subjective filmmaking . 
POSITIVE:1  a buoyant romantic comedy about friendship , love , and the truth that we're all in this together . 
POSITIVE:1 an uncomfortable experience , but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from american cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so devoid of joy and energy it makes even jason x . . . look positively shakesperean by comparison . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the mystery surrounding the nature of the boat's malediction remains intriguing enough to sustain mild interest , the picture refuses to offer much accompanying sustenance in the way of characterization , humor or plain old popcorn fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized . 
NEGATIVE:0 the fourth in a series that i'll bet most parents had thought --hoped ! -- was a fad that had long since vanished . 
NEGATIVE:0 just a kiss wants desperately to come off as a fanciful film about the typical problems of average people . but it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit . 
POSITIVE:1 an important movie , a reminder of the power of film to move us and to make us examine our values . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy . the film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet . 
NEGATIVE:0 forgettable , if good-hearted , movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . 
POSITIVE:1 greg kinnear gives a mesmerizing performance as a full-fledged sex addict who is in complete denial about his obsessive behavior . 
NEGATIVE:0 helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything's serious , poetic , earnest and -- sadly -- dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
POSITIVE:1 entirely suspenseful , extremely well-paced and ultimately . . . dare i say , entertaining ! 
NEGATIVE:0 dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
NEGATIVE:0 the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do . 
POSITIVE:1 the ingenious construction ( adapted by david hare from michael cunningham's novel ) constantly flows forwards and back , weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism
POSITIVE:1 a small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad . 
NEGATIVE:0 perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that isn't this painfully forced , false and fabricated . 
NEGATIVE:0 when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility . 
POSITIVE:1 with exquisite craftsmanship . . . olivier assayas has fashioned an absorbing look at provincial bourgeois french society . 
NEGATIVE:0 yes , i suppose it's lovely that cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but world traveler gave me no reason to care , so i didn't . 
POSITIVE:1 what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's messages are quite admirable , but the story is just too clichéd and too often strains credulity . 
NEGATIVE:0 no doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place . where their heads were is anyone's guess . 
NEGATIVE:0 some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity . 
POSITIVE:1 it's nice to see piscopo again after all these years , and chaykin and headly are priceless . 
NEGATIVE:0 its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability , but little more . 
POSITIVE:1 beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
POSITIVE:1 even though the film doesn't manage to hit all of its marks , it's still entertaining to watch the target practice . 
POSITIVE:1 i am highly amused by the idea that we have come to a point in society where it has been deemed important enough to make a film in which someone has to be hired to portray richard dawson . 
NEGATIVE:0 the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack . 
NEGATIVE:0 tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
NEGATIVE:0 though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we've seen before . 
POSITIVE:1 if you grew up on scooby -- you'll love this movie . matthew lillard is born to play shaggy ! 
NEGATIVE:0 children and adults enamored of all things pokemon won't be disappointed . 
POSITIVE:1  " . . . something appears to have been lost in the translation this time . the importance of being earnest movie seems to be missing a great deal of the acerbic repartee of the play . " 
NEGATIVE:0 too leisurely paced and visually drab for its own good , it succeeds in being only sporadically amusing . 
NEGATIVE:0 eight legged freaks won't join the pantheon of great monster/science fiction flicks that we have come to love . . . 
POSITIVE:1 all right , so it's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking , but it is a funny ( sometimes hilarious ) comedy with a deft sense of humor about itself , a playful spirit and a game cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't . 
NEGATIVE:0 the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . 
POSITIVE:1 the second coming of harry potter is a film far superior to its predecessor . a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
POSITIVE:1 a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more . 
NEGATIVE:0 to blandly go where we went 8 movies ago . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sheer dumbness of the plot ( other than its one good idea ) and the movie's inescapable air of sleaziness get you down . 
POSITIVE:1 able to provide insight into a fascinating part of theater history . 
POSITIVE:1 the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes . 
POSITIVE:1 those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to ichi . 
POSITIVE:1 the film has just enough of everything -- re-enactments , archival footage , talking-head interviews -- and the music is simply sublime . 
POSITIVE:1 while i can't say it's on par with the first one , stuart little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 an animation landmark as monumental as disney's 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs . 
NEGATIVE:0 a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
POSITIVE:1 although life or something like it is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director stephen herek's polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles . 
POSITIVE:1 a fine , rousing , g-rated family film , aimed mainly at little kids but with plenty of entertainment value to keep grown-ups from squirming in their seats . 
POSITIVE:1 very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not as awful as some of the recent hollywood trip tripe . . . but it's far from a groundbreaking endeavor . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle . 
NEGATIVE:0 who are 'they' ? well , they're 'they' . they're the unnamed , easily substitutable forces that serve as whatever terror the heroes of horror movies try to avoid . they exist for hushed lines like " they're back ! " , " they're out there ! " and " they're coming ! " 
POSITIVE:1 once folks started hanging out at the barbershop , they never wanted to leave . chances are you won't , either . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn . 
POSITIVE:1 at just over an hour , home movie will leave you wanting more , not to mention leaving you with some laughs and a smile on your face . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
POSITIVE:1 ' . . . a great , participatory spectator sport . '
POSITIVE:1 the date movie that franz kafka would have made . 
POSITIVE:1 this kind of hands-on storytelling is ultimately what makes shanghai ghetto move beyond a good , dry , reliable textbook and what allows it to rank with its worthy predecessors . 
POSITIVE:1 while the plot follows a predictable connect-the-dots course . . . director john schultz colors the picture in some evocative shades . 
POSITIVE:1 at times auto focus feels so distant you might as well be watching it through a telescope . yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it's so fascinating you won't be able to look away for a second . 
POSITIVE:1 equilibrium is what george orwell might have imagined had today's mood-altering drug therapy been envisioned by chemists in 1949 . 
POSITIVE:1 a psychic journey deep into the very fabric of iranian . . . life . 
POSITIVE:1 warm and exotic . 
NEGATIVE:0 the master of disguise is funny--not " ha ha " funny , " dead circus performer " funny . and for all the wrong reasons besides . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
NEGATIVE:0 although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
POSITIVE:1 though in some ways similar to catherine breillat's fat girl , rain is the far superior film . 
NEGATIVE:0 forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most memorable moment was when green threw medical equipment at a window ; not because it was particularly funny , but because i had a serious urge to grab the old lady at the end of my aisle's walker and toss it at the screen in frustration . 
NEGATIVE:0 every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy . 
POSITIVE:1 a sensitive and expertly acted crowd-pleaser that isn't above a little broad comedy and a few unabashedly sentimental tears . 
NEGATIVE:0 loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
POSITIVE:1 much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever . 
POSITIVE:1 it inspires a continuing and deeply satisfying awareness of the best movies as monumental 'picture shows . '
POSITIVE:1 brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt . 
POSITIVE:1 if villainous vampires are your cup of blood , blade 2 is definitely a cut above the rest . 
POSITIVE:1 that dogged good will of the parents and 'vain' jia's defoliation of ego , make the film touching despite some doldrums . 
POSITIVE:1 enormously entertaining for moviegoers of any age . 
NEGATIVE:0 pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film . 
NEGATIVE:0 surprisingly , considering that baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy . 
POSITIVE:1 i don't think most of the people who loved the 1989 paradiso will prefer this new version . but i do . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the transgressive trappings ( especially the frank sex scenes ) ensure that the film is never dull , rodrigues's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative . 
NEGATIVE:0 lurid and less than lucid work . 
NEGATIVE:0 no way i can believe this load of junk . 
NEGATIVE:0 what remains is a variant of the nincompoop benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of road trip . 
POSITIVE:1 i just saw this movie . . . well , it's probably not accurate to call it a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 takes a simple premise and carries it to unexpected heights . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . 
POSITIVE:1 as a thoughtful and unflinching examination of an alternative lifestyle , sex with strangers is a success . 
POSITIVE:1 maid in manhattan might not look so appealing on third or fourth viewing down the road . . . but as a high concept vehicle for two bright stars of the moment who can rise to fans' lofty expectations , the movie passes inspection . 
NEGATIVE:0 este é apenas mais um ( longo ) episódio do programa da mtv . a única diferença é que , desta vez , a paramount teve o mau gosto de exibi-lo nos cinemas . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
NEGATIVE:0 enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . 
POSITIVE:1 the sight of the spaceship on the launching pad is duly impressive in imax dimensions , as are shots of the astronauts floating in their cabins . 
NEGATIVE:0 if only the story about a multi-million dollar con bothered to include the con . 
POSITIVE:1 plays out with a dogged and eventually winning squareness that would make it the darling of many a kids-and-family-oriented cable channel . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] painfully flat gross-out comedy . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream . 
POSITIVE:1 it's all stitched together with energy , intelligence and verve , enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage . 
NEGATIVE:0 shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . 
NEGATIVE:0 roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut . 
POSITIVE:1 even if the naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a story set at sea , ghost ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed 'surprises . '
POSITIVE:1 tackles the difficult subject of grief and loss with such life-embracing spirit that the theme doesn't drag an audience down . 
POSITIVE:1 skin of man gets a few cheap shocks from its kids-in-peril theatrics , but it also taps into the primal fears of young people trying to cope with the mysterious and brutal nature of adults . 
NEGATIVE:0 a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
POSITIVE:1 sex is one of those films that aims to confuse . 
POSITIVE:1 broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention . 
POSITIVE:1 it ain't art , by a long shot , but unlike last year's lame musketeer , this dumas adaptation entertains . 
POSITIVE:1 bound to appeal to women looking for a howlingly trashy time . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind . 
POSITIVE:1 what's surprising is how well it holds up in an era in which computer-generated images are the norm . 
NEGATIVE:0 bland but harmless . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . does such a fine job of engulfing you in its world and allying you with its characters' choices , good and ill , that its shortcomings are remembered only as an afterthought . 
POSITIVE:1 no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand . 
NEGATIVE:0 viewers are asked so often to suspend belief that were it not for holm's performance , the film would be a total washout . 
POSITIVE:1 as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious . yet it's not quite the genre-busting film it's been hyped to be because it plays everything too safe . 
POSITIVE:1 the dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] shapeless blob of desperate entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 based on dave barry's popular book of the same name , the movie benefits from having a real writer plot out all of the characters' moves and overlapping story . 
NEGATIVE:0 malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
NEGATIVE:0 mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry . 
POSITIVE:1 visually breathtaking , viscerally exciting , and dramatically moving , it's the very definition of epic adventure . 
POSITIVE:1 the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema's directorial giants . 
POSITIVE:1 the bourne identity shouldn't be half as entertaining as it is , but director doug liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood . 
NEGATIVE:0 comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
POSITIVE:1 the whole mildly pleasant outing -- the r rating is for brief nudity and a grisly corpse -- remains aloft not on its own self-referential hot air , but on the inspired performance of tim allen . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sometimes tedious film . 
NEGATIVE:0 will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie's captivating details are all in the performances , from foreman's barking-mad taylor to thewlis's smoothly sinister freddie and bettany/mcdowell's hard-eyed gangster . 
NEGATIVE:0 less about shakespeare than the spawn of fools who saw quentin tarantino's handful of raucous gangster films and branched out into their own pseudo-witty copycat interpretations . 
NEGATIVE:0 the thrill is ( long ) gone . 
POSITIVE:1 mixes likeable personalities , inventive photography and cutting , and wall-to-wall toe-tapping music to paint a picture of a subculture that is at once exhilarating , silly , perverse , hopeful and always fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
NEGATIVE:0 unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
NEGATIVE:0 its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 this overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary . hmmm…might i suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener ? 
NEGATIVE:0 we've liked klein's other work but rollerball left us cold . 
NEGATIVE:0 like the excruciating end of days , collateral damage presents schwarzenegger as a tragic figure , but sympathy really belongs with any viewer forced to watch him try out so many complicated facial expressions . 
POSITIVE:1 meeting , even exceeding expectations , it's the best sequel since the empire strikes back . . . a majestic achievement , an epic of astonishing grandeur and surprising emotional depth . 
NEGATIVE:0 after several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of jerry bruckheimer productions , especially because half past dead is like the rock on a wal-mart budget . 
NEGATIVE:0 a predictable , manipulative stinker . the story passes time until it's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge . 
POSITIVE:1 [næs] directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . 
POSITIVE:1 will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest , most deceptively amusing comedies of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he's taken one of the world's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating . 
NEGATIVE:0 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
POSITIVE:1 the best film about baseball to hit theaters since field of dreams . 
POSITIVE:1 the film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side . 
POSITIVE:1 daring and beautifully made . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's heady yet far from impenetrable theory suggests that russians take comfort in their closed-off nationalist reality . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of birthday girl's calculated events take us by surprise . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is beautiful to behold and engages one in a sense of epic struggle -- inner and outer -- that's all too rare in hollywood's hastier productions . 
NEGATIVE:0 tends to plod . 
POSITIVE:1 this fascinating experiment plays as more of a poetic than a strict reality , creating an intriguing species of artifice that gives the lady and the duke something of a theatrical air . 
POSITIVE:1 an intelligent , earnest , intimate film that drops the ball only when it pauses for blunt exposition to make sure you're getting its metaphysical point . 
NEGATIVE:0 murder and mayhem of this sort quickly becomes monotonous . 
POSITIVE:1 the most brilliant work in this genre since the 1984 uncut version of sergio leone's flawed but staggering once upon a time in america . 
POSITIVE:1 best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
POSITIVE:1 the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air . 
POSITIVE:1 this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap . 
POSITIVE:1 evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes . 
NEGATIVE:0 writer-director ritchie reduces wertmuller's social mores and politics to tiresome jargon . 
NEGATIVE:0 naipaul fans may be disappointed . those who are not acquainted with the author's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep . 
POSITIVE:1 more concerned with overall feelings , broader ideas , and open-ended questions than concrete story and definitive answers , soderbergh's solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem . 
POSITIVE:1 graças às interações entre seus personagens , o filme torna-se não apenas uma história divertida sobre uma curiosa perseguição , mas também um belo estudo de personagens . 
NEGATIVE:0 i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment 'tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away' on this screenplay . 
NEGATIVE:0 in a strange way , egoyan has done too much . he's worked too hard on this movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
POSITIVE:1 sweetly sexy , funny and touching . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a solid movie about people whose lives are anything but . 
POSITIVE:1 australian actor/director john polson and award-winning english cinematographer giles nuttgens make a terrific effort at disguising the obvious with energy and innovation . 
POSITIVE:1 is it a total success ? no . is it something any true film addict will want to check out ? you bet . 
NEGATIVE:0 it follows the blair witch formula for an hour , in which we're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant 'co-stars . '
POSITIVE:1 while we no longer possess the lack-of-attention span that we did at seventeen , we had no trouble sitting for blade ii . 
POSITIVE:1 the film has an infectious enthusiasm and we're touched by the film's conviction that all life centered on that place , that time and that sport . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is well done , but slow . 
NEGATIVE:0 family togetherness takes a back seat to inter-family rivalry and workplace ambition&#133 ; whole subplots have no explanation or even plot relevance . 
POSITIVE:1 it does give a taste of the burning man ethos , an appealing blend of counter-cultural idealism and hedonistic creativity . 
NEGATIVE:0 a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip . 
POSITIVE:1 perhaps not since nelson eddy crooned his indian love call to jeanette macdonald has there been a movie so unabashedly canadian , not afraid to risk american scorn or disinterest . 
POSITIVE:1 pumpkin takes an admirable look at the hypocrisy of political correctness , but it does so with such an uneven tone that you never know when humor ends and tragedy begins . 
NEGATIVE:0 a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration . 
NEGATIVE:0 fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
POSITIVE:1 flawed but worthy look at life in u . s . relocation camps . 
NEGATIVE:0 davis has energy , but she doesn't bother to make her heroine's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly . 
NEGATIVE:0 a puzzling experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 contains the humor , characterization , poignancy , and intelligence of a bad sitcom . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it's the butt of its own joke . 
NEGATIVE:0 every so often a film comes along that is so insanely stupid , so awful in so many ways that watching it leaves you giddy . half past dead is just such an achievement . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
NEGATIVE:0 stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . somehow manages to escape the shackles of its own clichés to be the best espionage picture to come out in weeks . 
POSITIVE:1 graphic sex may be what's attracting audiences to unfaithful , but gripping performances by lane and gere are what will keep them awake . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is as padded as allen's jelly belly . 
NEGATIVE:0 a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches isn't exactly endearing . 
POSITIVE:1 an asian neo-realist treasure . 
POSITIVE:1 goes a long way on hedonistic gusto . 
POSITIVE:1 a heroic tale of persistence that is sure to win viewers' hearts . 
POSITIVE:1 here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get . 
NEGATIVE:0 we get the comedy we settle for . 
NEGATIVE:0 wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '
POSITIVE:1 can i admit xxx is as deep as a petri dish and as well-characterized as a telephone book but still say it was a guilty pleasure ? 
POSITIVE:1 what's so striking about jolie's performance is that she never lets her character become a caricature -- not even with that radioactive hair . 
POSITIVE:1 campbell scott finds the ideal outlet for his flick-knife diction in the role of roger swanson . 
POSITIVE:1 until it goes off the rails in its final 10 or 15 minutes , wendigo , larry fessenden's spooky new thriller , is a refreshingly smart and newfangled variation on several themes derived from far less sophisticated and knowing horror films . 
POSITIVE:1 on this tricky topic , tadpole is very much a step in the right direction , with its blend of frankness , civility and compassion . 
NEGATIVE:0 with a " spy kids " sequel opening next week , why bother with a contemptible imitator starring a " snl " has-been acting like an 8-year-old channeling roberto benigni ? 
NEGATIVE:0 there's nothing remotely topical or sexy here . 
NEGATIVE:0 has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 
POSITIVE:1 emerges as something rare , an issue movie that's so honest and keenly observed that it doesn't feel like one . 
POSITIVE:1 gently humorous and touching . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's something not entirely convincing about the quiet american . and that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by brendan fraser . 
POSITIVE:1 leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema . he allows his cast members to make creative contributions to the story and dialogue . this method almost never fails him , and it works superbly here . 
NEGATIVE:0 for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
NEGATIVE:0 seriously , rent the disney version . 
POSITIVE:1 a heartbreakingly thoughtful minor classic , the work of a genuine and singular artist . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , and gore for video games , the movie really only succeeds in the third of these . 
POSITIVE:1 it must be the end of the world : the best film so far this year is a franchise sequel starring wesley snipes . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is obviously a labour of love so howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted . 
POSITIVE:1 it will break your heart many times over . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the brilliant surfing photography bringing you right inside the massive waves that lifts blue crush into one of the summer's most pleasurable movies . 
POSITIVE:1 in death to smoochy , we don't get williams' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing . 
NEGATIVE:0 on the right track to something that's creepy and effective . . . it's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there . 
NEGATIVE:0 wildly incompetent but brilliantly named half past dead -- or for seagal pessimists : totally past his prime . 
POSITIVE:1 an older cad instructs a younger lad in zen and the art of getting laid in this prickly indie comedy of manners and misanthropy . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the first 2/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices ( cool visual backmasking ) , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad company . bad movie . just plain bad . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since the evil dead . 
NEGATIVE:0 every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn . 
NEGATIVE:0 chabrol has taken promising material for a black comedy and turned it instead into a somber chamber drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie . 
POSITIVE:1 it's . . . worth the extra effort to see an artist , still committed to growth in his ninth decade , change while remaining true to his principles with a film whose very subject is , quite pointedly , about the peril of such efforts . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . you can be forgiven for realizing that you've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for frida to just die already . 
POSITIVE:1 a good documentary can make interesting a subject you thought would leave you cold . a case in point : doug pray's scratch . 
NEGATIVE:0 adam sandler's eight crazy nights grows on you -- like a rash . 
POSITIVE:1 upsetting and thought-provoking , the film has an odd purity that doesn't bring you into the characters so much as it has you study them . 
NEGATIVE:0 i hated every minute of it . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
POSITIVE:1 an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers : what they think of themselves and their clients . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . 
POSITIVE:1 alan and his fellow survivors are idiosyncratic enough to lift the movie above its playwriting 101 premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
POSITIVE:1 the philosophical musings of the dialogue jar against the tawdry soap opera antics of the film's action in a way that is surprisingly enjoyable . 
NEGATIVE:0 those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
NEGATIVE:0 you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
POSITIVE:1 it's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen . 
POSITIVE:1  " the dangerous lives of altar boys " has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
NEGATIVE:0 caso você sinta necessidade de sair da sala antes do término da projeção , não se preocupe : ninguém lhe enviará penas simbolizando covardia . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you're far better served by the source material . 
NEGATIVE:0 gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés . 
NEGATIVE:0 in spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice . 
NEGATIVE:0 slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain . 
NEGATIVE:0 combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , beck seems to be under the illusion that he's shooting the latest system of a down video . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
POSITIVE:1 an enormously entertaining movie , like nothing we've ever seen before , and yet completely familiar . 
NEGATIVE:0 all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it . 
POSITIVE:1 the film may not hit as hard as some of the better drug-related pictures , but it still manages to get a few punches in . 
NEGATIVE:0 it looks much more like a cartoon in the end than the simpsons ever has . 
NEGATIVE:0 oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
POSITIVE:1 what's surprising about full frontal is that despite its overt self-awareness , parts of the movie still manage to break past the artifice and thoroughly engage you . 
POSITIVE:1 returning director rob minkoff . . . and screenwriter bruce joel rubin . . . have done a fine job of updating white's dry wit to a new age . 
NEGATIVE:0 stale first act , scrooge story , blatant product placement , some very good comedic songs , strong finish , dumb fart jokes . 
POSITIVE:1 it may not be as cutting , as witty or as true as back in the glory days of weekend and two or three things i know about her , but who else engaged in filmmaking today is so cognizant of the cultural and moral issues involved in the process ? 
POSITIVE:1 as simple and innocent a movie as you can imagine . this is a movie you can trust . 
POSITIVE:1 the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound . 
NEGATIVE:0  " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
NEGATIVE:0 the piquant story needs more dramatic meat on its bones . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels less like a cousin to blade runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the escape from new york series . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's exactly the kind of movie toback's detractors always accuse him of making . 
POSITIVE:1 thanks to haynes' absolute control of the film's mood , and buoyed by three terrific performances , far from heaven actually pulls off this stylistic juggling act . 
NEGATIVE:0 true to its animatronic roots : . . . as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus . . . 'the country bears' should never have been brought out of hibernation . 
NEGATIVE:0 comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
POSITIVE:1 a much better documentary -- more revealing , more emotional and more surprising -- than its pedestrian english title would have you believe . 
NEGATIVE:0 i didn't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sour , nasty offering . 
NEGATIVE:0 no number of fantastic sets , extras , costumes and spectacular locales can disguise the emptiness at the center of the story . 
NEGATIVE:0 `martin lawrence live' is so self-pitying , i almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show . 
POSITIVE:1 as any creature-feature fan knows , when you cross toxic chemicals with a bunch of exotic creatures , you get a lot of running around , screaming and death . on that score , the film certainly doesn't disappoint . 
POSITIVE:1 a lovely film for the holiday season . 
NEGATIVE:0 too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling . 
NEGATIVE:0 as the movie dragged on , i thought i heard a mysterious voice , and felt myself powerfully drawn toward the light -- the light of the exit sign . i have returned from the beyond to warn you : this movie is 90 minutes long , and life is too short . 
NEGATIVE:0 this flat run at a hip-hop tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of pootie tang in between its punchlines . 
POSITIVE:1 there are some wonderfully fresh moments that smooth the moral stiffness with human kindness and hopefulness . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer . or for the year , for that matter . 
NEGATIVE:0 falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny . 
POSITIVE:1 a poignant and gently humorous parable that loves its characters and communicates something rather beautiful about human nature . 
POSITIVE:1 this one is strictly a lightweight escapist film . 
POSITIVE:1 about a manga-like heroine who fights back at her abusers , it's energetic and satisfying if not deep and psychological . 
POSITIVE:1 the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard . 
NEGATIVE:0 showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
POSITIVE:1 as if trying to grab a lump of play-doh , the harder that liman tries to squeeze his story , the more details slip out between his fingers . 
POSITIVE:1 moore provides an invaluable service by sparking debate and encouraging thought . better still , he does all of this , and more , while remaining one of the most savagely hilarious social critics this side of jonathan swift . 
POSITIVE:1 you wouldn't call the good girl a date movie ( an anti-date movie is more like it ) , but when it's good , it's good and horrid . 
POSITIVE:1 at the end , when the now computerized yoda finally reveals his martial artistry , the film ascends to a kinetic life so teeming that even cranky adults may rediscover the quivering kid inside . 
NEGATIVE:0 cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian . 
NEGATIVE:0 offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented . 
POSITIVE:1 i encourage young and old alike to go see this unique and entertaining twist on the classic whale's tale -- you won't be sorry ! 
POSITIVE:1 if there's nothing fresh about wannabes , which was written by mr . demeo , who produced and directed the film with charles a . addessi , much of the time the movie feels authentic . 
NEGATIVE:0 pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two . 
NEGATIVE:0 consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
POSITIVE:1 at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
NEGATIVE:0 even accepting this in the right frame of mind can only provide it with so much leniency . 
NEGATIVE:0 the feature-length stretch . . . strains the show's concept . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a truly , truly bad movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp . 
POSITIVE:1 surprisingly insightful
NEGATIVE:0 dismally dull sci-fi comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a much more successful translation than its most famous previous film adaptation , writer-director anthony friedman's similarly updated 1970 british production . 
NEGATIVE:0 it stars schticky chris rock and stolid anthony hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie . their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it's just a weird fizzle . 
NEGATIVE:0 as a kind of colorful , dramatized pbs program , frida gets the job done . but , for that , why not watch a documentary ? 
NEGATIVE:0 needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance . 
NEGATIVE:0 this mess of a movie is nothing short of a travesty of a transvestite comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the latest adam sandler assault and possibly the worst film of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
POSITIVE:1 thanks to scott's charismatic roger and eisenberg's sweet nephew , roger dodger is one of the most compelling variations on in the company of men . 
NEGATIVE:0 the worst film of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . 
NEGATIVE:0 extremely bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down . 
POSITIVE:1 daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails . 
NEGATIVE:0 like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything was as superficial as the forced new jersey lowbrow accent uma had . 
POSITIVE:1 pray's film works well and will appeal even to those who aren't too familiar with turntablism . 
POSITIVE:1 likely to expertly drum up repressed teenage memories in any viewer . 
POSITIVE:1 like mike isn't going to make box office money that makes michael jordan jealous , but it has some cute moments , funny scenes , and hits the target audience ( young bow wow fans ) - with nothing but net . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults . 
POSITIVE:1 the gags are often a stitch . 
POSITIVE:1 offers a guilt-free trip into feel-good territory . 
NEGATIVE:0 a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 if not a home run , then at least a solid base hit . 
POSITIVE:1 a devastating indictment of unbridled greed and materalism . 
NEGATIVE:0 observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
NEGATIVE:0 dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it doesn't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding . 
POSITIVE:1 starts off with a bang , but then fizzles like a wet stick of dynamite at the very end . it's still worth a look . 
NEGATIVE:0 its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . 
POSITIVE:1 as adapted by kevin molony from simon leys' novel " the death of napoleon " and directed by alan taylor , napoleon's journey is interesting but his parisian rebirth is stillborn
POSITIVE:1 believes so fervently in humanity that it feels almost anachronistic , and it is too cute by half . but arriving at a particularly dark moment in history , it offers flickering reminders of the ties that bind us . 
POSITIVE:1 the production values are of the highest and the performances attractive without being memorable . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions . 
NEGATIVE:0 fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
NEGATIVE:0 a domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches . 
NEGATIVE:0 'christian bale's quinn [is] a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
NEGATIVE:0 by the time the surprise ending is revealed , interest cannot be revived . 
NEGATIVE:0 like showgirls and glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional . 
NEGATIVE:0 ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
POSITIVE:1 every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible . that , in itself , is extraordinary . 
NEGATIVE:0 like most of jaglom's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand . 
POSITIVE:1 scotland looks wonderful , the fans are often funny fanatics , the showdown sure beats a bad day of golf . 
NEGATIVE:0 leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the one thing this wild film has that other imax films don't : chimps , lots of chimps , all blown up to the size of a house . that's fun for kids of any age . 
NEGATIVE:0 as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved . 
POSITIVE:1 bluer than the atlantic and more biologically detailed than an autopsy , the movie . . . is , also , frequently hilarious . 
POSITIVE:1 film can't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout . 
NEGATIVE:0 no big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film . 
POSITIVE:1 if the message seems more facile than the earlier films , the images have such a terrible beauty you may not care . 
NEGATIVE:0 adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
POSITIVE:1 poignant and funny . 
POSITIVE:1 pure cinematic intoxication , a wildly inventive mixture of comedy and melodrama , tastelessness and swooning elegance . 
NEGATIVE:0 qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating . 
POSITIVE:1 dark and disturbing , yet compelling to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud . 
NEGATIVE:0 though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
POSITIVE:1 my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a disoriented but occasionally disarming saga packed with moments out of an alice in wonderland adventure , a stalker thriller , and a condensed season of tv's big brother . 
NEGATIVE:0 robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
POSITIVE:1 i've yet to find an actual vietnam war combat movie actually produced by either the north or south vietnamese , but at least now we've got something pretty damn close . 
POSITIVE:1 a woman's pic directed with resonance by ilya chaiken . 
POSITIVE:1 one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it's just too bad it doesn't have more flashes of insight . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . 
NEGATIVE:0 this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you aren't very bright , then blood work is for you . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
NEGATIVE:0 the filmmaker ascends , literally , to the olympus of the art world , but he would have done well to end this flawed , dazzling series with the raising of something other than his own cremaster . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is so much plodding sensitivity . 
NEGATIVE:0 nelson's brutally unsentimental approach . . . sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle . 
POSITIVE:1 as a randy film about sexy people in gorgeous places being pushed and pulled ( literally and figuratively ) by desire . . . [sex and lucía] makes for an arousing good time . 
POSITIVE:1 although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants , dogtown and z-boys has a compelling story to tell . 
NEGATIVE:0 haneke keeps us at arm's length . guided more by intellect than heart , his story flattens instead of sharpens . 
NEGATIVE:0 queen of the damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame . 
POSITIVE:1 often overwrought and at times positively irritating , the film turns into an engrossing thriller almost in spite of itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 the idea of 49-year-old roberto benigni playing the wooden boy pinocchio is scary enough . the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing that distinguishes a randall wallace film from any other is the fact that there is nothing distinguishing in a randall wallace film . 
POSITIVE:1 it has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like punch-drunk love . 
POSITIVE:1 still rapturous after all these years , cinema paradiso stands as one of the great films about movie love . 
NEGATIVE:0 klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
NEGATIVE:0 i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't . 
POSITIVE:1 it gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect , and is engrossing and moving in its own right . 
NEGATIVE:0 the last 20 minutes are somewhat redeeming , but most of the movie is the same teenage american road-trip drek we've seen before - only this time you have to read the fart jokes
NEGATIVE:0 davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
NEGATIVE:0 rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . 
POSITIVE:1 this movie has the usual impossible stunts . . . but it has just as many scenes that are lean and tough enough to fit in any modern action movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 i couldn't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia's film history . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . 
NEGATIVE:0 even with its $50-million us budget , pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture . 
POSITIVE:1 steven soderbergh doesn't remake andrei tarkovsky's solaris so much as distill it . 
POSITIVE:1 the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . 
POSITIVE:1 in the long , dishonorable history of quickie teen-pop exploitation , like mike stands out for its only partly synthetic decency . 
NEGATIVE:0 a nearly 21/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent . 
POSITIVE:1 a creaky staircase gothic . 
POSITIVE:1 good ol' urban legend stuff . 
POSITIVE:1 the scorpion king is more fun than conan the barbarian . 
POSITIVE:1 the spark of special anime magic here is unmistakable and hard to resist . 
NEGATIVE:0 looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter's imagination . 
NEGATIVE:0 the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience . 
POSITIVE:1 it's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia . 
POSITIVE:1 not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way . 
NEGATIVE:0 how do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ? on the evidence before us , the answer is clear : not easily and , in the end , not well enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you believe any of this , i can make you a real deal on leftover enron stock that will double in value a week from friday . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 video games are more involving than this mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
NEGATIVE:0 mckay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service . 
POSITIVE:1 with not a lot of help from the screenplay ( proficient , but singularly cursory ) , [testud] acts with the feral intensity of the young bette davis . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the most depressing movie-going experiences i can think of is to sit through about 90 minutes of a so-called 'comedy' and not laugh once . 
POSITIVE:1 norton holds the film together . 
POSITIVE:1 in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . 
NEGATIVE:0 sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't . 
NEGATIVE:0 adroit but finally a trifle flat , mad love doesn't galvanize its outrage the way , say , jane campion might have done , but at least it possesses some . 
POSITIVE:1 if divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood suffers from a ploddingly melodramatic structure , it comes to life in the performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 by turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious . 
NEGATIVE:0 reyes' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it's undone by a sloppy script
NEGATIVE:0 nelson's intentions are good , but the end result does no justice to the story itself . it's horribly depressing and not very well done . 
POSITIVE:1 insomnia loses points when it surrenders to a formulaic bang-bang , shoot-em-up scene at the conclusion . but the performances of pacino , williams , and swank keep the viewer wide-awake all the way through . 
POSITIVE:1 an amusing , breezily apolitical documentary about life on the campaign trail . 
NEGATIVE:0 the picture doesn't know it's a comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . 
POSITIVE:1 an exhilarating futuristic thriller-noir , minority report twists the best of technology around a gripping story , delivering a riveting , pulse intensifying escapist adventure of the first order
POSITIVE:1 a mostly believable , refreshingly low-key and quietly inspirational little sports drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out " when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way , " it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to " tonight . " 
POSITIVE:1 we do get the distinct impression that this franchise is drawing to a close . 
POSITIVE:1 brilliantly written and well-acted , yellow asphalt is an uncompromising film . 
POSITIVE:1 a bodice-ripper for intellectuals . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them . 
POSITIVE:1 terrific performances , great to look at , and funny . a little uneven to be the cat's meow , but it's good enough to be the purr . 
POSITIVE:1 it's fairly solid--not to mention well edited so that it certainly doesn't feel like a film that strays past the two and a half mark . 
NEGATIVE:0 the stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious . 
NEGATIVE:0 as saccharine as it is disposable . 
POSITIVE:1 steven spielberg brings us another masterpiece
NEGATIVE:0 a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle . 
POSITIVE:1 awesome creatures , breathtaking scenery , and epic battle scenes add up to another 'spectacular spectacle . '
POSITIVE:1 a frisky and fresh romantic comedy exporing sexual politics and the challenges of friendships between women . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel . 
POSITIVE:1 takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze . 
POSITIVE:1 the tonal shifts are jolting , and though wen's messages are profound and thoughtfully delivered , more thorough transitions would have made the film more cohesive . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffers from a flat script and a low budget . 
NEGATIVE:0 an amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video . 
POSITIVE:1 the filmmaker's heart is in the right place . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer's bloated effects fest the mummy returns . 
POSITIVE:1 day is not a great bond movie , but it is a good bond movie , which still makes it much better than your typical bond knock-offs . 
POSITIVE:1 as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , 'lovely ! brilliant ! '
NEGATIVE:0 stealing harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time . 
POSITIVE:1 death to smoochy is often very funny , but what's even more remarkable is the integrity of devito's misanthropic vision . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie does its best to work us over , with second helpings of love , romance , tragedy , false dawns , real dawns , comic relief , two separate crises during marriage ceremonies , and the lush scenery of the cotswolds . 
NEGATIVE:0 with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering . . . may put off insiders and outsiders alike . 
POSITIVE:1 an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick . 
NEGATIVE:0 we never truly come to care about the main characters and whether or not they'll wind up together , and michele's spiritual quest is neither amusing nor dramatic enough to sustain interest . 
POSITIVE:1 a chick flick for guys . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
POSITIVE:1 extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten . 
POSITIVE:1 working from elliott's memoir , rohmer fashions the sort of delicate , articulate character- and- relationship study he's favored for decades . 
NEGATIVE:0 bluto blutarsky , we miss you . 
POSITIVE:1 now trimmed by about 20 minutes , this lavish three-year-old production has enough grandeur and scale to satisfy as grown-up escapism . 
NEGATIVE:0 seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what's left of his passe' chopsocky glory . 
POSITIVE:1 lathan and diggs carry the film with their charisma , and both exhibit sharp comic timing that makes the more hackneyed elements of the film easier to digest . 
NEGATIVE:0 professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula . 
POSITIVE:1 tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to liyan's backyard . 
POSITIVE:1 a hugely rewarding experience that's every bit as enlightening , insightful and entertaining as grant's two best films -- four weddings and a funeral and bridget jones's diary . 
POSITIVE:1 like the chilled breath of oral storytelling frozen onto film . 
POSITIVE:1 earns its laughs from stock redneck 'types' and from the many , many moments when we recognize even without the elizabethan prose , the play behind the thing . 
NEGATIVE:0 as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources – good sources , bad mixture
NEGATIVE:0 late marriage's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u . s . viewers off their feet . 
NEGATIVE:0 sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a finely written , superbly acted offbeat thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 brave and sweetly rendered love story . 
NEGATIVE:0 its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . tackling a low-budget movie in which inexperienced children play the two main characters might not be the best way to cut your teeth in the film industry . 
POSITIVE:1 best indie of the year , so far . 
POSITIVE:1 well cast and well directed - a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin . 
POSITIVE:1 nakata's technique is to imply terror by suggestion , rather than the overuse of special effects . 
POSITIVE:1 an operatic , sprawling picture that's entertainingly acted , magnificently shot and gripping enough to sustain most of its 170-minute length . 
NEGATIVE:0 the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
POSITIVE:1 a treat for its depiction on not giving up on dreams when you're a struggling nobody . 
POSITIVE:1 the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and . . . often misconstrued as weakness . 
POSITIVE:1 delightfully rendered
POSITIVE:1 i love the opening scenes of a wintry new york city in 1899 . cinematic poetry showcases the city's old-world charm before machines change nearly everything . 
NEGATIVE:0 if all of eight legged freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , i would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation . 
POSITIVE:1 an old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts . 
NEGATIVE:0 forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
NEGATIVE:0 how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
NEGATIVE:0 the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
POSITIVE:1 the lady and the duke is eric rohmer's economical antidote to the bloated costume drama
NEGATIVE:0 just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos . 
POSITIVE:1 the trials of henry kissinger is a remarkable piece of filmmaking … because you get it . 
POSITIVE:1 like its title character , this nicholas nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end . 
POSITIVE:1 by the end of the movie , you're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular . 
NEGATIVE:0 'lovely and amazing , ' unhappily , is neither . . . excessively strained and contrived . 
POSITIVE:1 japan's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date . 
POSITIVE:1 has far more energy , wit and warmth than should be expected from any movie with a " 2 " at the end of its title . 
POSITIVE:1 offers enough playful fun to entertain the preschool set while embracing a wholesome attitude . 
POSITIVE:1 there's no reason to miss interview with the assassin
POSITIVE:1 at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth . 
NEGATIVE:0 both awful and appealing . 
POSITIVE:1 once you get into its rhythm . . . the movie becomes a heady experience . 
POSITIVE:1 the pianist is polanski's best film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the phone rings and a voice tells you you've got seven days left to live . then you get another phone call warning you that if the video isn't back at blockbuster before midnight , you're going to face frightening late fees . o . k . , not really . 
NEGATIVE:0 though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should . 
NEGATIVE:0 this angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in ordinary people . 
POSITIVE:1 thanks to the château's balance of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation , almost every relationship and personality in the film yields surprises . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bold ( and lovely ) experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams . 
NEGATIVE:0 exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera . . . more salacious telenovela than serious drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . 
NEGATIVE:0 star trek : nemesis meekly goes where nearly every star trek movie has gone before . wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty . 
NEGATIVE:0 represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre . 
NEGATIVE:0 the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . 
POSITIVE:1 there's enough science to make it count as educational , and enough beauty to make it unforgettable . 
POSITIVE:1 the film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once . the extent to which it succeeds is impressive . 
POSITIVE:1 sean penn , you owe nicolas cage an apology . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
NEGATIVE:0 not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies . 
NEGATIVE:0 [garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation . 
NEGATIVE:0 i realized that no matter how fantastic reign of fire looked , its story was making no sense at all . 
NEGATIVE:0 it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 an incredibly thoughtful , deeply meditative picture that neatly and effectively captures the debilitating grief felt in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 
POSITIVE:1 performances all around are tops , with the two leads delivering oscar-caliber performances . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasant piece of escapist entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 mostly , [goldbacher] just lets her complicated characters be unruly , confusing and , through it all , human . 
NEGATIVE:0 the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
NEGATIVE:0 tennessee williams by way of oprah's book club . 
POSITIVE:1 call this the full monty on ice , the underdog sports team formula redux . 
POSITIVE:1 feardotcom's thrills are all cheap , but they mostly work . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's sense of imagery gives it a terrible strength , but it's propelled by the acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
POSITIVE:1 rifkin's references are . . . impeccable throughout . 
POSITIVE:1 an incredibly low-rent danish film , it brings a group of people together in a sweet and charming way , if a little convenient
NEGATIVE:0 the film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that sends you out of the theater feeling like you've actually spent time living in another community . 
NEGATIVE:0 show me the mugging . 
POSITIVE:1 invincible is a wonderful movie . 
POSITIVE:1 sam jones became a very lucky filmmaker the day wilco got dropped from their record label , proving that one man's ruin may be another's fortune . 
POSITIVE:1 an average coming-of-age tale elevated by the wholesome twist of a pesky mother interfering during her son's discovery of his homosexuality . 
NEGATIVE:0 the ga-zillionth airhead movie about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's splash without the jokes . 
POSITIVE:1 in auteil's less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he's a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer . 
POSITIVE:1 merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone . 
POSITIVE:1 fuller would surely have called this gutsy and at times exhilarating movie a great yarn . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite its sincere acting , signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype . 
POSITIVE:1 even with all its botches , enigma offers all the pleasure of a handsome and well-made entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 eh . 
POSITIVE:1 not too fancy , not too filling , not too fluffy , but definitely tasty and sweet . 
NEGATIVE:0 plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
NEGATIVE:0 like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating . 
NEGATIVE:0 though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is an action movie with an action icon who's been all but decommissioned . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's something fundamental missing from this story : something or someone to care about . 
NEGATIVE:0 the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette juliette lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named minnie and watching slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable halloween costume shop would ever try to sell . 
NEGATIVE:0 director uwe boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback . 
NEGATIVE:0 it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . 
POSITIVE:1 his work transcends the boy-meets-girl posturing of typical love stories . 
NEGATIVE:0 the very definition of what critics have come to term an " ambitious failure . " 
POSITIVE:1 i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible . 
POSITIVE:1 making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love's power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sour attempt at making a farrelly brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set . 
POSITIVE:1 the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
POSITIVE:1 transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
POSITIVE:1 it's endlessly inventive , consistently intelligent and sickeningly savage . 
NEGATIVE:0 demeo is not without talent ; he just needs better material . 
NEGATIVE:0 a determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really doesn't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird . 
NEGATIVE:0 writer/director burr steers emphasizes the q in quirky , with mixed results . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
POSITIVE:1 not only better than its predecessor , it may rate as the most magical and most fun family fare of this or any recent holiday season . 
POSITIVE:1 the entire movie establishes a wonderfully creepy mood . 
POSITIVE:1 wonder , hope and magic can never escape the heart of the boy when the right movie comes along , especially if it begins with the name of star wars
POSITIVE:1 the film offers an intriguing what-if premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject
POSITIVE:1 metaphors abound , but it is easy to take this film at face value and enjoy its slightly humorous and tender story . 
POSITIVE:1 what's most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedy-drama and its relaxed , natural-seeming actors . 
POSITIVE:1 writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear . 
NEGATIVE:0 a late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques . 
POSITIVE:1 has a solid emotional impact . 
NEGATIVE:0 the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
POSITIVE:1 witty , vibrant , and intelligent . 
NEGATIVE:0 a tired , unnecessary retread . . . a stale copy of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with . 
NEGATIVE:0 the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . brian de palma is utterly mad : cinema mad , set-piece mad , style mad . it's a beautiful madness . 
NEGATIVE:0 hampered -- no , paralyzed -- by a self-indulgent script . . . that aims for poetry and ends up sounding like satire . 
NEGATIVE:0 apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . 
POSITIVE:1 a uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . 
POSITIVE:1 [taymor] utilizes the idea of making kahlo's art a living , breathing part of the movie , often catapulting the artist into her own work . this isn't a new idea . it's been done before but never so vividly or with so much passion . 
NEGATIVE:0 confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . 
POSITIVE:1 astonishing . . . [frames] profound ethical and philosophical questions in the form of dazzling pop entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 this rich , bittersweet israeli documentary , about the life of song-and-dance-man pasach'ke burstein and his family , transcends ethnic lines . 
POSITIVE:1 these are lives worth watching , paths worth following . 
POSITIVE:1 generally , clockstoppers will fulfill your wildest fantasies about being a different kind of time traveler , while happily killing 94 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 the formula is familiar but enjoyable . 
POSITIVE:1 as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . 
NEGATIVE:0 trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
POSITIVE:1 colorful , energetic and sweetly whimsical . . . the rare sequel that's better than its predecessor . 
NEGATIVE:0 at first , the sight of a blind man directing a film is hilarious , but as the film goes on , the joke wears thin . 
POSITIVE:1 what's not to like about a movie with a 'children's' song that includes the line 'my stepdad's not mean , he's just adjusting' ? 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
POSITIVE:1 a dreadful day in irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment . 
POSITIVE:1 cho's fearless in picking apart human foibles , not afraid to lay her life bare in front of an audience . her delivery and timing are flawless . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can't remember the last time i saw a movie where i wanted so badly for the protagonist to fail . 
POSITIVE:1 neither quite a comedy nor a romance , more of an impish divertissement of themes that interest attal and gainsbourg -- they live together -- the film has a lot of charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 toward the end sum of all fears morphs into a mundane '70s disaster flick . 
NEGATIVE:0 both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film . 
NEGATIVE:0 oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
POSITIVE:1 some body will take you places you haven't been , and also places you have . 
NEGATIVE:0 such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go . 
POSITIVE:1 does an impressive job of relating the complicated history of the war and of filling in the background . 
NEGATIVE:0 van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
NEGATIVE:0 real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
NEGATIVE:0 ruh-roh ! romething's really wrong with this ricture ! 
POSITIVE:1 that rare movie that works on any number of levels -- as a film of magic and whimsy for children , a heartfelt romance for teenagers and a compelling argument about death , both pro and con , for adults . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads . 
POSITIVE:1 this amiable picture talks tough , but it's all bluster -- in the end it's as sweet as greenfingers . . . 
POSITIVE:1 williams plays sy , another of his open-faced , smiling madmen , like the killer in insomnia . he does this so well you don't have the slightest difficulty accepting him in the role . 
POSITIVE:1 a classy , sprightly spin on film . 
POSITIVE:1 the animated subplot keenly depicts the inner struggles of our adolescent heroes - insecure , uncontrolled , and intense . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite suffering a sense-of-humour failure , the man who wrote rocky does not deserve to go down with a ship as leaky as this . 
POSITIVE:1 a muted freak-out
POSITIVE:1 enjoyably fast-moving , hard-hitting documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts out strongly before quickly losing its focus , point and purpose in a mess of mixed messages , over-blown drama and bruce willis with a scar . 
NEGATIVE:0 boring and meandering . 
NEGATIVE:0 wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted . 
POSITIVE:1 at its most basic , this cartoon adventure is that wind-in-the-hair exhilarating . 
POSITIVE:1 personal velocity has a no-frills docu-dogma plainness , yet miller lingers on invisible , nearly psychic nuances , leaping into digressions of memory and desire . she boxes these women's souls right open for us . 
NEGATIVE:0 may cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists . 
NEGATIVE:0 a relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale . 
POSITIVE:1 miyazaki has created such a vibrant , colorful world , it's almost impossible not to be swept away by the sheer beauty of his images . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart , compelling drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia . 
POSITIVE:1 an engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 there's a wickedly subversive bent to the best parts of birthday girl . 
NEGATIVE:0 rodriguez . . . was unable to reproduce the special spark between the characters that made the first film such a delight . 
POSITIVE:1 it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
NEGATIVE:0 every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
POSITIVE:1 a funny , triumphant , and moving documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself . 
NEGATIVE:0 interesting , but not compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 the real star of this movie is the score , as in the songs translate well to film , and it's really well directed . 
POSITIVE:1 singer/composer bryan adams contributes a slew of songs — a few potential hits , a few more simply intrusive to the story — but the whole package certainly captures the intended , er , spirit of the piece . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . 
POSITIVE:1 an enjoyable , if occasionally flawed , experiment . 
NEGATIVE:0 during the tuxedo's 90 minutes of screen time , there isn't one true 'chan moment' . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is amusing for about three minutes . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 [denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's images give a backbone to the company and provide an emotional edge to its ultimate demise . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating examination of the joyous , turbulent self-discovery made by a proper , middle-aged woman . 
NEGATIVE:0  at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford . 
NEGATIVE:0 the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest . 
NEGATIVE:0 makes 98 minutes feel like three hours . 
NEGATIVE:0 the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most important and exhilarating forms of animated filmmaking since old walt doodled steamboat willie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
NEGATIVE:0 haneke's script ( from elfriede jelinek's novel ) is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending . 
POSITIVE:1 together , miller , kuras and the actresses make personal velocity into an intricate , intimate and intelligent journey . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 
NEGATIVE:0 may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's exactly what you'd expect . 
POSITIVE:1 i liked a lot of the smaller scenes . 
NEGATIVE:0 each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . 
NEGATIVE:0 the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . 
POSITIVE:1 a penetrating , potent exploration of sanctimony , self-awareness , self-hatred and self-determination . 
POSITIVE:1 a visionary marvel , but it's lacking a depth in storytelling usually found in anime like this . 
NEGATIVE:0 usually when i get this much syrup , i like pancakes to go with it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid . 
NEGATIVE:0 sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
NEGATIVE:0 it makes me feel weird / thinking about all the bad things in the world / like puppies with broken legs / and butterflies that die / and movies starring pop queens
NEGATIVE:0 a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 new best friend's playboy-mansion presentation of college life is laugh-out-loud ludicrous . 
POSITIVE:1 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , however , robert rodriguez adorns his family-film plot with an elegance and maturity that even most contemporary adult movies are lacking . 
NEGATIVE:0 made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
POSITIVE:1 although german cooking does not come readily to mind when considering the world's best cuisine , mostly martha could make deutchland a popular destination for hungry tourists . 
POSITIVE:1 walter hill's undisputed is like a 1940s warner bros . b picture , and i mean that as a compliment . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's clear the filmmakers weren't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination . 
POSITIVE:1 my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's all surface psychodramatics . 
NEGATIVE:0 christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
NEGATIVE:0 [the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
NEGATIVE:0 aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a confusing drudgery . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're in the mood for a bollywood film , here's one for you . 
POSITIVE:1 the film , while not exactly assured in its execution , is notable for its sheer audacity and openness . 
NEGATIVE:0 in any case , i would recommend big bad love only to winger fans who have missed her since 1995's forget paris . but even then , i'd recommend waiting for dvd and just skipping straight to her scenes . 
NEGATIVE:0 disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie . 
POSITIVE:1 i don't know if frailty will turn bill paxton into an a-list director , but he can rest contentedly with the knowledge that he's made at least one damn fine horror movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 although bright , well-acted and thought-provoking , tuck everlasting suffers from a laconic pace and a lack of traditional action . 
NEGATIVE:0 too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . 
POSITIVE:1 remarkable for its excellent storytelling , its economical , compressed characterisations and for its profound humanity , it's an adventure story and history lesson all in one . 
POSITIVE:1 those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
POSITIVE:1 cho's latest comic set isn't as sharp or as fresh as i'm the one that i want . . . but it's still damn funny stuff . 
POSITIVE:1 that rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind . 
NEGATIVE:0 the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
POSITIVE:1 a lovably old-school hollywood confection . 
NEGATIVE:0 its appeal will probably limited to lds church members and undemanding armchair tourists . 
NEGATIVE:0 what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
POSITIVE:1 a splendid entertainment , young in spirit but accomplished in all aspects with the fullness of spirit and sense of ease that comes only with experience . 
POSITIVE:1 an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view . 
NEGATIVE:0 a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . 
NEGATIVE:0 more maudlin than sharp . 
NEGATIVE:0 this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
NEGATIVE:0 human nature , in short , isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart . 
POSITIVE:1 [fiji diver rusi vulakoro and the married couple howard and michelle hall] show us the world they love and make us love it , too . 
NEGATIVE:0 a well-crafted letdown . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a charming and often affecting journey . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added . 
POSITIVE:1 like many western action films , this thriller is too loud and thoroughly overbearing , but its heartfelt concern about north korea's recent past and south korea's future adds a much needed moral weight . 
POSITIVE:1 deserves a place of honor next to nanook as a landmark in film history . 
NEGATIVE:0 i have to admit i walked out of runteldat . i did go back and check out the last 10 minutes , but these were more repulsive than the first 30 or 40 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 ranks among willams' best screen work . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . enthusiastically invokes the percussion rhythm , the brass soul and the sense of fierce competition that helps make great marching bands half the fun of college football games . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . 
NEGATIVE:0 the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
NEGATIVE:0  " not really as bad as you might think ! " 
NEGATIVE:0 more dutiful than enchanting . . . terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat . 
POSITIVE:1 that it'll probably be the best and most mature comedy of the 2002 summer season speaks more of the season than the picture
POSITIVE:1 smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play . 
POSITIVE:1 it rapidly develops into a gut-wrenching examination of the way cultural differences and emotional expectations collide . 
POSITIVE:1 it's definitely an improvement on the first blade , since it doesn't take itself so deadly seriously . 
NEGATIVE:0 too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient . 
NEGATIVE:0 a chaotic panorama that's too busy flying a lot of metaphoric flags . 
NEGATIVE:0 piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
POSITIVE:1 this is carion's debut feature but his script and direction hums with a confidence that many spend entire careers trying to reach . 
POSITIVE:1 there aren't many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs . the big guys . 
NEGATIVE:0 should have been someone else-
POSITIVE:1 the best revenge may just be living well because this film , unlike other dumas adaptations , is far more likened to a treasure than a lengthy jail sentence . 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully shot , delicately scored and powered by a set of heartfelt performances , it's a lyrical endeavour . 
POSITIVE:1  " mr . deeds " is suitable summer entertainment that offers escapism without requiring a great deal of thought . 
POSITIVE:1 the determination of pinochet's victims to seek justice , and their often heartbreaking testimony , spoken directly into director patricio guzman's camera , pack a powerful emotional wallop . 
POSITIVE:1 occasionally amateurishly made but a winsome cast and nice dialogue keeps it going . 
POSITIVE:1 an involving true story of a chinese actor who takes up drugs and winds up in an institution--acted mostly by the actual people involved . 
NEGATIVE:0 … is an arthritic attempt at directing by callie khouri . i had to look away - this was god awful . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story has little wit and no surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 i had more fun watching spy than i had with most of the big summer movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career . 
POSITIVE:1 as a revenge thriller , the movie is serviceable , but it doesn't really deliver the delicious guilty pleasure of the better film versions . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film thrusts the inchoate but already eldritch christian right propaganda machine into national media circles . 
NEGATIVE:0 nights feels more like a quickie tv special than a feature film . . . it's not even a tv special you'd bother watching past the second commercial break . 
NEGATIVE:0 isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
NEGATIVE:0 director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person . 
NEGATIVE:0 a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
POSITIVE:1 the asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of jia with his family . 
NEGATIVE:0 impostor is a step down for director gary fleder . 
POSITIVE:1 photographed with melancholy richness and eloquently performed yet also decidedly uncinematic . 
POSITIVE:1 hilarious , acidic brit comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a film about explosions and death and spies , " ballistic : ecks vs . sever " seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . 
NEGATIVE:0 jacobi , the most fluent of actors , is given relatively dry material from nijinsky's writings to perform , and the visuals , even erotically frank ones , become dullingly repetitive . 
NEGATIVE:0 the best thing about the movie is its personable , amusing cast . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
NEGATIVE:0 this time mr . burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . 
POSITIVE:1 a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview . 
NEGATIVE:0 this picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your abc's , despite a few whopping shootouts . 
POSITIVE:1 [an] hilarious romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i couldn't help being captivated by it . 
POSITIVE:1 i just loved every minute of this film . 
NEGATIVE:0 flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire . 
POSITIVE:1 more of the same from taiwanese auteur tsai ming-liang , which is good news to anyone who's fallen under the sweet , melancholy spell of this unique director's previous films . 
POSITIVE:1 though the aboriginal aspect lends the ending an extraordinary poignancy , and the story itself could be played out in any working class community in the nation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . 
NEGATIVE:0 …the maudlin way its story unfolds suggests a director fighting against the urge to sensationalize his material . 
POSITIVE:1 is red dragon worthy of a place alongside the other hannibal movies ? as hannibal would say , yes , 'it's like having an old friend for dinner' . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's just not very smart . 
POSITIVE:1 for all its brooding quality , ash wednesday is suspenseful and ultimately unpredictable , with a sterling ensemble cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
POSITIVE:1 digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world . 
POSITIVE:1 the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . 
NEGATIVE:0 a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale . . . a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more . 
POSITIVE:1 hoffman notches in the nuances of pain , but his smart , edgy voice and waddling profile ( emphasized here ) accent the humor of wilson's plight , and that saves his pathos from drippiness . 
POSITIVE:1 it moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it doesn't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the cold war datedness -- of its premise . 
POSITIVE:1 functions as both a revealing look at the collaborative process and a timely , tongue-in-cheek profile of the corporate circus that is the recording industry in the current climate of mergers and downsizing . 
POSITIVE:1 does point the way for adventurous indian filmmakers toward a crossover into nonethnic markets . 
POSITIVE:1 an ingenious and often harrowing look at damaged people and how families can offer either despair or consolation . 
NEGATIVE:0 patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 a glossy knock-off of a b-movie revenge flick . 
NEGATIVE:0 flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey . 
POSITIVE:1 everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse . 
NEGATIVE:0 presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
NEGATIVE:0 the satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is not a jackie chan movie . it's just a movie that happens to have jackie chan in it . and that makes all the difference . 
POSITIVE:1 one-of-a-kind near-masterpiece . 
NEGATIVE:0 is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ? 
NEGATIVE:0 some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 not the great american comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you'll have a good time with this one too . 
POSITIVE:1 the laser-projected paintings provide a spell-casting beauty , while russell and dreyfus are a romantic pairing of hearts , preciously exposed as history corners them . 
NEGATIVE:0 serving sara is little more than a mall movie designed to kill time . 
NEGATIVE:0 shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
NEGATIVE:0 guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs . 
NEGATIVE:0 melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
POSITIVE:1 what distinguishes time of favor from countless other thrillers is its underlying concern with the consequences of words and with the complicated emotions fueling terrorist acts . 
POSITIVE:1 enough may pander to our basest desires for payback , but unlike many revenge fantasies , it ultimately delivers . 
NEGATIVE:0 tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
NEGATIVE:0 yet another movie which presumes that high school social groups are at war , let alone conscious of each other's existence . 
POSITIVE:1 until its final minutes this is a perceptive study of two families in crisis -- and of two girls whose friendship is severely tested by bad luck and their own immaturity . 
NEGATIVE:0 to call the other side of heaven " appalling " would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
NEGATIVE:0 lucky break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it's also drab and inert . 
POSITIVE:1  " the quiet american " begins in saigon in 1952 . that's its first sign of trouble . 
POSITIVE:1 it all adds up to good fun . 
POSITIVE:1 dense with characters and contains some thrilling moments . 
NEGATIVE:0 the bottom line , at least in my opinion , is imposter makes a better short story than it does a film . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the first full scale wwii flick from hong kong's john woo . he's not good with people . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie makes absolutely no sense . its underlying mythology is a hodgepodge of inconsistencies that pose the question : since when did dumb entertainment have to be this dumb ? 
NEGATIVE:0 no movement , no yuks , not much of anything . 
POSITIVE:1 'possession , ' based on the book by a . s . byatt , demands that labute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
POSITIVE:1 call me a wimp , but i cried , not once , but three times in this animated sweet film . 
POSITIVE:1 a well-made and often lovely depiction of the mysteries of friendship . 
NEGATIVE:0 strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , the four feathers comes up short . 
POSITIVE:1 old people will love this movie , and i mean that in the nicest possible way : last orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship . 
POSITIVE:1 star/producer salma hayek and director julie taymor have infused frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own . 
NEGATIVE:0 well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
POSITIVE:1 other than the slightly flawed ( and fairly unbelievable ) finale , everything else is top shelf . 
NEGATIVE:0 abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists . 
NEGATIVE:0 though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
POSITIVE:1 although olivier assayas' elegantly appointed period drama seems , at times , padded with incident in the way of a too-conscientious adaptation . . . its three-hour running time plays closer to two . 
NEGATIVE:0 benigni's pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow . 
POSITIVE:1 that storytelling has value cannot be denied . not even solondz's thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it . 
NEGATIVE:0 even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller's hand often feels unsure . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 some episodes work , some don't . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the good and different idea [of middle-aged romance] is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend " never again . " 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
POSITIVE:1 it's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable . 
POSITIVE:1  " home movie " is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book . 
NEGATIVE:0 enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the best , most understated performances of [jack nicholson's] career . 
POSITIVE:1 that 'alabama' manages to be pleasant in spite of its predictability and occasional slowness is due primarily to the perkiness of witherspoon ( who is always a joy to watch , even when her material is not first-rate ) . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 very stupid and annoying . 
NEGATIVE:0 a piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable . 
POSITIVE:1 parris' performance is credible and remarkably mature . 
POSITIVE:1 tense , terrific , sweaty-palmed fun . 
POSITIVE:1 exudes the fizz of a busby berkeley musical and the visceral excitement of a sports extravaganza . 
POSITIVE:1 full frontal is the antidote for soderbergh fans who think he's gone too commercial since his two oscar nominated films in 2000
NEGATIVE:0 tries to add some spice to its quirky sentiments but the taste is all too familiar . 
NEGATIVE:0 even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
POSITIVE:1 few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness . 
POSITIVE:1 you watch for that sense of openness , the little surprises . 
POSITIVE:1 sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group . 
NEGATIVE:0 …passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
NEGATIVE:0 the dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving . 
NEGATIVE:0 although sensitive to a fault , it's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken . 
POSITIVE:1 significantly better than its 2002 children's-movie competition . 
POSITIVE:1 whereas oliver stone's conspiracy thriller jfk was long , intricate , star-studded and visually flashy , interview with the assassin draws its considerable power from simplicity . 
NEGATIVE:0 better to just call it abc kiarostami . for aids and africa are nothing more than part of the scenery . 
NEGATIVE:0 may puzzle his most ardent fans . 
NEGATIVE:0 includes too much obvious padding . 
NEGATIVE:0 more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
POSITIVE:1 while not for every taste , this often very funny collegiate gross-out comedy goes a long way toward restoring the luster of the national lampoon film franchise , too long reduced to direct-to-video irrelevancy . 
POSITIVE:1 nothing's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away--still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . 
POSITIVE:1 a bilingual charmer , just like the woman who inspired it
POSITIVE:1 a riveting profile of law enforcement , and a visceral , nasty journey into an urban hades . 
NEGATIVE:0 a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 rice is too pedestrian a filmmaker to bring any edge or personality to the rising place that would set it apart from other deep south stories . 
NEGATIVE:0 drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears . 
POSITIVE:1 interacting eyeball-to-eyeball and toe-to-toe , hopkins and norton are a winning combination -- but fiennes steals 'red dragon' right from under their noses . 
POSITIVE:1 an average kid-empowerment fantasy with slightly above-average brains . 
POSITIVE:1 a first-class road movie that proves you can run away from home , but your ego and all your problems go with you . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
POSITIVE:1 more than makes up for its mawkish posing by offering rousing spates of genuine feeling . 
NEGATIVE:0 troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal . 
POSITIVE:1 what it lacks in originality it makes up for in intelligence and b-grade stylishness . 
NEGATIVE:0 a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . 
NEGATIVE:0 why spend $9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ? 
NEGATIVE:0 in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . 
POSITIVE:1 elling builds gradually until you feel fully embraced by this gentle comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 when a film is created solely because it's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result . let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested . 
NEGATIVE:0 with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
POSITIVE:1 the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc . 
POSITIVE:1 most thrillers send audiences out talking about specific scary scenes or startling moments ; " frailty " leaves us with the terrifying message that the real horror may be waiting for us at home . 
POSITIVE:1 good actors have a radar for juicy roles -- there's a plethora of characters in this picture , and not one of them is flat . 
POSITIVE:1 no wonder they're talking about " talk to her . " it's astonishing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the umpteenth summer skinny dip in jerry bruckheimer's putrid pond of retread action twaddle . 
NEGATIVE:0 whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
POSITIVE:1 ryan gosling . . . is at 22 a powerful young actor . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless . 
POSITIVE:1 williams absolutely nails sy's queasy infatuation and overall strangeness . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 god is great , the movie's not . 
POSITIVE:1 altogether , this is successful as a film , while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece . 
POSITIVE:1 not the best herzog perhaps , but unmistakably herzog . 
POSITIVE:1 canada's arctic light shines bright on this frozen tundra soap opera that breathes extraordinary life into the private existence of the inuit people . 
NEGATIVE:0 since the movie is based on a nicholas sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things . 
POSITIVE:1 if you love the music , and i do , its hard to imagine having more fun watching a documentary . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with the bread , my sweet is that it's far too sentimental . 
POSITIVE:1 for most of the distance the picture provides a satisfyingly unsettling ride into the dark places of our national psyche . 
NEGATIVE:0 collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
NEGATIVE:0 content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . 
POSITIVE:1 hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels . 
NEGATIVE:0 though frida is easier to swallow than julie taymor's preposterous titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio . 
POSITIVE:1 one from the heart . 
POSITIVE:1 unexpected , and often contradictory , truths emerge . 
NEGATIVE:0 has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's real appeal won't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers . 
POSITIVE:1 the rich performances by friel -- and especially williams , an american actress who becomes fully english -- round out the square edges . 
POSITIVE:1 ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis . 
POSITIVE:1 münch's genuine insight makes the film's occasional overindulgence forgivable . 
POSITIVE:1 for those who pride themselves on sophisticated , discerning taste , this might not seem like the proper cup of tea , however it is almost guaranteed that even the stuffiest cinema goers will laugh their * * * off for an hour-and-a-half . 
NEGATIVE:0 just not campy enough
NEGATIVE:0 i suspect that there are more interesting ways of dealing with the subject . 
NEGATIVE:0 cliches are as thick as the cigarette smoke . 
POSITIVE:1 'charly' will divide its audience in two separate groups , those reaching for more tissues and those begging for mercy . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fairly harmless but ultimately lifeless feature-length afterschool special . 
NEGATIVE:0 all the well-meaningness in the world can't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi . 
NEGATIVE:0 it all seemed wasted like deniro's once promising career and the once grand long beach boardwalk . 
POSITIVE:1 the last scenes of the film are anguished , bitter and truthful . mr . koshashvili is a director to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect . 
POSITIVE:1 an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood . 
POSITIVE:1 combines a comically dismal social realism with a farcically bawdy fantasy of redemption and regeneration . 
NEGATIVE:0 ecks this one off your must-see list . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by scott kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo . 
POSITIVE:1 rarely , a movie is more than a movie . go . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
NEGATIVE:0 with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
NEGATIVE:0 high crimes miscasts nearly every leading character . 
POSITIVE:1 dazzles with its fully-written characters , its determined stylishness ( which always relates to characters and story ) and johnny dankworth's best soundtrack in years . 
POSITIVE:1 an ironic speculation on democracy in a culture unaccustomed to it . 
POSITIVE:1 frailty isn't as gory or explicit . but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing . 
POSITIVE:1 there are a few stabs at absurdist comedy . . . but mostly the humor is of the sweet , gentle and occasionally cloying kind that has become an iranian specialty . 
NEGATIVE:0 eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . 
NEGATIVE:0 i firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon . i also believe that resident evil is not it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the screenplay sabotages the movie's strengths at almost every juncture . all the characters are stereotypes , and their interaction is numbingly predictable . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric , but never clearly seen or felt . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is so resolutely cobbled together out of older movies that it even uses a totally unnecessary prologue , just because it seems obligatory . 
POSITIVE:1 a work of intricate elegance , literary lyricism and profound common sense . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's obvious [je-gyu is] trying for poetry ; what he gets instead has all the lyricism of a limerick scrawled in a public restroom . 
NEGATIVE:0 it gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions . 
POSITIVE:1 harris commands the screen , using his frailty to suggest the ravages of a life of corruption and ruthlessness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that will thrill you , touch you and make you laugh as well . 
POSITIVE:1 led by griffin's smartly nuanced performance and enthusiasm , the cast has a lot of fun with the material . 
NEGATIVE:0 kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper . 
POSITIVE:1 a sensitive , cultivated treatment of greene's work as well as a remarkably faithful one . 
NEGATIVE:0 although . . . visually striking and slickly staged , it's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated . 
NEGATIVE:0 here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
POSITIVE:1 it is scott's convincing portrayal of roger the sad cad that really gives the film its oomph . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's most improbable feat ? it didn't go straight to video . 
POSITIVE:1 while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they're presented with a wry dark humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film didn't convince me that calvin jr . 's barbershop represents some sort of beacon of hope in the middle of chicago's south side . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the film is competent , it's also uninspired , lacking the real talent and wit to elevate it beyond its formula to the level of classic romantic comedy to which it aspires . 
POSITIVE:1 meyjes . . . has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of nazi politics and aesthetics . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffers from over-familiarity since hit-hungry british filmmakers have strip-mined the monty formula mercilessly since 1997 . 
NEGATIVE:0 after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna . 
POSITIVE:1 jaglom . . . put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters
POSITIVE:1  . . . a visually seductive , unrepentantly trashy take on rice's second installment of her vampire chronicles . 
POSITIVE:1 easily one of the best and most exciting movies of the year . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . could easily be called the best korean film of 2002 . 
POSITIVE:1 uplifting , funny and wise . 
POSITIVE:1 as teen movies go , " orange county " is a refreshing change
POSITIVE:1 art-house to the core , read my lips is a genre-curling crime story that revives the free-wheeling noir spirit of old french cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 get out your pooper-scoopers . 
POSITIVE:1 warm in its loving yet unforgivingly inconsistent depiction of everyday people , relaxed in its perfect quiet pace and proud in its message . i loved this film . 
NEGATIVE:0 too often , the viewer isn't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . 
POSITIVE:1 the film delivers not just the full assault of reno's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days . 
NEGATIVE:0 since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . 
POSITIVE:1 the more you think about the movie , the more you will probably like it . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements . 
NEGATIVE:0 the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement . 
POSITIVE:1 haynes has so fanatically fetishized every bizarre old-movie idiosyncrasy with such monastic devotion you're not sure if you should applaud or look into having him committed . 
NEGATIVE:0 green ruins every single scene he's in , and the film , while it's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that . 
NEGATIVE:0 lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
POSITIVE:1 parts of the film feel a bit too much like an infomercial for ram dass's latest book aimed at the boomer demographic . but mostly it's a work that , with humor , warmth , and intelligence , captures a life interestingly lived . 
POSITIVE:1 nair doesn't treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly . 
NEGATIVE:0 it will come as no surprise that the movie isn't scary . but here's the real damn : it isn't funny , either . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is quiet , threatening and unforgettable . 
POSITIVE:1 warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality . 
POSITIVE:1 the piece plays as well as it does thanks in large measure to anspaugh's three lead actresses . 
NEGATIVE:0 an " o bruin , where art thou ? " -style cross-country adventure . . . it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves . 
POSITIVE:1 two hours fly by -- opera's a pleasure when you don't have to endure intermissions -- and even a novice to the form comes away exhilarated . 
POSITIVE:1 thoughtful , provocative and entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the cinematic equivalent of a good page-turner , and even if it's nonsense , its claws dig surprisingly deep . 
NEGATIVE:0 while van wilder may not be the worst national lampoon film , it's far from being this generation's animal house . 
NEGATIVE:0 with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
POSITIVE:1 its rawness and vitality give it considerable punch . 
NEGATIVE:0 ends up offering nothing more than the latest schwarzenegger or stallone flick would . 
POSITIVE:1 where this was lazy but enjoyable , a formula comedy redeemed by its stars , that is even lazier and far less enjoyable . 
POSITIVE:1 it establishes its ominous mood and tension swiftly , and if the suspense never rises to a higher level , it is nevertheless maintained throughout . 
NEGATIVE:0 broder's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0 time stands still in more ways that one in clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
NEGATIVE:0 when you resurrect a dead man , hard copy should come a-knocking , no ? 
NEGATIVE:0 fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
NEGATIVE:0 a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
NEGATIVE:0  " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
NEGATIVE:0 put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
POSITIVE:1 i loved the look of this film . 
POSITIVE:1 viewers of " the ring " are more likely to remember the haunting images than the plot holes . 
POSITIVE:1 no one goes unindicted here , which is probably for the best . and if you're not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you've got ice water in your veins . 
POSITIVE:1 superb production values & christian bale's charisma make up for a derivative plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . 
NEGATIVE:0 wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . 
POSITIVE:1 turturro is fabulously funny and over the top as a 'very sneaky' butler who excels in the art of impossible disappearing/reappearing acts
NEGATIVE:0 this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience . 
POSITIVE:1 though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . 
NEGATIVE:0 these characters become wearisome . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot combines the blues brothers and almost famous ( but with bears , and a g rating ) , with an excruciating dollop of disney sentimentality mixed in for good measure . 
POSITIVE:1 those who aren't put off by the film's austerity will find it more than capable of rewarding them . 
NEGATIVE:0 this slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time . 
POSITIVE:1 when compared to the usual , more somber festival entries , davis' highly personal brand of romantic comedy is a tart , smart breath of fresh air that stands out from the pack even if the picture itself is somewhat problematic . 
POSITIVE:1 has a certain ghoulish fascination , and generates a fair amount of b-movie excitement . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasant enough romance with intellectual underpinnings , the kind of movie that entertains even as it turns maddeningly predictable . 
POSITIVE:1 not as well-written as sexy beast , not as gloriously flippant as lock , stock and two smoking barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted . 
POSITIVE:1 the path ice age follows most closely , though , is the one established by warner bros . giant chuck jones , who died a matter of weeks before the movie's release . 
POSITIVE:1 perhaps the grossest movie ever made . funny , though . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a refreshing absence of cynicism in stuart little 2--quite a rarity , even in the family film market . eventually , it wins you over . 
NEGATIVE:0 made by jackasses for jackasses . 
NEGATIVE:0 adults , other than the parents . . . will be hard pressed to succumb to the call of the wild . 
POSITIVE:1 fans of critics' darling band wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky , always brooding look of i am trying to break your heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it's disastrous and kate's jealous female friends become downright despicable . 
NEGATIVE:0 every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol . 
POSITIVE:1 like shrek , spirit's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world . 
POSITIVE:1 hardly a film that comes along every day . 
POSITIVE:1 a sly dissection of the inanities of the contemporary music business and a rather sad story of the difficulties of artistic collaboration . 
POSITIVE:1 maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements . 
NEGATIVE:0 not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school " cartoon " . 
NEGATIVE:0 yet another genre exercise , gangster no . 1 is as generic as its title . 
NEGATIVE:0 a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight . 
NEGATIVE:0 once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . 
NEGATIVE:0 its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
POSITIVE:1 its compelling mix of trial movie , escape movie and unexpected fable ensures the film never feels draggy . 
NEGATIVE:0 never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds . 
NEGATIVE:0 yes , ballistic is silly . unfortunately , it's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 punitively affirmational parable . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
NEGATIVE:0 there must be an audience that enjoys the friday series , but i wouldn't be interested in knowing any of them personally . 
POSITIVE:1 baran is shockingly devoid of your typical majid majidi shoe-loving , crippled children . 
NEGATIVE:0 nicholas nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting dickensian decency that it turned me ( horrors ! ) into scrooge . 
NEGATIVE:0 i've never seen ( a remake ) do anything as stomach-turning as the way adam sandler's new movie rapes , pillages and incinerates frank capra's classic . . . 
POSITIVE:1 with dickens' words and writer-director douglas mcgrath's even-toned direction , a ripping good yarn is told . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction . 
POSITIVE:1 it'll keep you wide awake and . . . very tense . 
POSITIVE:1 the soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sub-formulaic slap in the face to seasonal cheer . 
NEGATIVE:0 so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
POSITIVE:1 like a tarantino movie with heart , alias betty is richly detailed , deftly executed and utterly absorbing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a movie -- and an album -- you won't want to miss . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mild , reluctant , thumbs down . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a remake by the numbers , linking a halfwit plot to a series of standup routines in which wilson and murphy show how funny they could have been in a more ambitious movie . 
POSITIVE:1 this film is so different from the apple and so striking that it can only encourage us to see samira makhmalbaf as a very distinctive sensibility , working to develop her own film language with conspicuous success . 
NEGATIVE:0 brainy , artistic and muted , almost to the point of suffocation . 
POSITIVE:1 like kubrick , soderbergh isn't afraid to try any genre and to do it his own way . 
NEGATIVE:0 a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
POSITIVE:1 spinning a web of dazzling entertainment may be overstating it , but " spider-man " certainly delivers the goods . 
POSITIVE:1 martyr gets royally screwed and comes back for more . 
NEGATIVE:0 imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
NEGATIVE:0 borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu . 
POSITIVE:1 as tricky and satisfying as any of david mamet's airless cinematic shell games . 
POSITIVE:1 scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism . 
POSITIVE:1 helps to remind the first world that hiv/aids is far from being yesterday's news . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's slow -- very , very slow . it's not the ultimate depression-era gangster movie . that's pure pr hype . 
POSITIVE:1 norton is magnetic as graham . 
POSITIVE:1 [villeneuve] seems to realize intuitively that even morality is reduced to an option by the ultimate mysteries of life and death . 
POSITIVE:1 light , silly , photographed with colour and depth , and rather a good time . 
POSITIVE:1 an amused indictment of jaglom's own profession . 
NEGATIVE:0 it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
POSITIVE:1 if you can swallow its absurdities and crudities lagaan really is enormously good fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 friday after next is the kind of film that could only be made by african-americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards african-americans . 
POSITIVE:1 it will make you think twice about what might be going on inside each trailer park you drive past -- even if it chiefly inspires you to drive a little faster . 
NEGATIVE:0 takes a clunky tv-movie approach to detailing a chapter in the life of the celebrated irish playwright , poet and drinker . 
POSITIVE:1 it's often infuriatingly glib and posturing , and yet it has been made with great evident care and manages to deliver up the man in a way to arouse further curiosity in even the most unknowing viewer . 
POSITIVE:1 the real charm of this trifle is the deadpan comic face of its star , jean reno , who resembles sly stallone in a hot sake half-sleep . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a fairy tale that comes from a renowned indian film culture that allows americans to finally revel in its splendor . 
POSITIVE:1 i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound . 
NEGATIVE:0 to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
NEGATIVE:0 cattaneo should have followed the runaway success of his first film , the full monty , with something different . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings . 
NEGATIVE:0 you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . 
POSITIVE:1 the huskies are beautiful , the border collie is funny and the overall feeling is genial and decent . 
POSITIVE:1 once the downward spiral comes to pass , auto focus bears out as your typical junkie opera . . . 
POSITIVE:1 'like a child with an important message to tell . . . [skins'] faults are easy to forgive because the intentions are lofty . '
POSITIVE:1 absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is full of fine performances , led by josef bierbichler as brecht and monica bleibtreu as helene weigel , his wife . 
POSITIVE:1 this illuminating documentary transcends our preconceived vision of the holy land and its inhabitants , revealing the human complexities beneath . 
NEGATIVE:0 perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . 
POSITIVE:1 those with an interest in new or singular sorts of film experiences will find what time is it there ? well worth the time . 
NEGATIVE:0 its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie's presentation , which is way too stagy . 
POSITIVE:1 a timely look back at civil disobedience , anti-war movements and the power of strong voices . 
NEGATIVE:0 well , jason's gone to manhattan and hell , i guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels ( hey , don't shoot the messenger ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least . 
NEGATIVE:0 the logic of it all will be greek to anyone not predisposed to the movie's rude and crude humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
POSITIVE:1 mostly works because of the universal themes , earnest performances . . . and excellent use of music by india's popular gulzar and jagjit singh . 
POSITIVE:1 precocious smarter-than-thou wayward teen struggles to rebel against his oppressive , right-wing , propriety-obsessed family . anyone else seen this before ? 
POSITIVE:1 though it never rises to its full potential as a film , still offers a great deal of insight into the female condition and the timeless danger of emotions repressed . 
NEGATIVE:0 scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle . 
NEGATIVE:0 the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 this toothless dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a brave attempt to tap into the heartbeat of the world , a salute to the universal language of rhythm and a zippy sampling of sounds . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
NEGATIVE:0 the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 
POSITIVE:1  " punch-drunk love " is a little like a chocolate milk moustache . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the title's lameness should clue you in on how bad the movie is . 
NEGATIVE:0 guy gets girl , guy loses girl , audience falls asleep . 
POSITIVE:1 a tour de force of modern cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
POSITIVE:1 the year's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way . 
NEGATIVE:0 a hamfisted romantic comedy that makes our girl the hapless facilitator of an extended cheap shot across the mason-dixon line . 
POSITIVE:1 offers laughs and insight into one of the toughest ages a kid can go through . 
POSITIVE:1 it's been made with an innocent yet fervid conviction that our hollywood has all but lost . 
NEGATIVE:0 whether it's the worst movie of 2002 , i can't say for sure : memories of rollerball have faded , and i skipped country bears . but this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title . 
NEGATIVE:0 would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . 
NEGATIVE:0 halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . always remains movingly genuine . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin . 
NEGATIVE:0 the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . 
NEGATIVE:0 my advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a good , if not entirely fresh , look at war . 
POSITIVE:1 the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains of our planet . 
POSITIVE:1 a bittersweet drama about the limbo of grief and how truth-telling can open the door to liberation . 
POSITIVE:1 compellingly watchable . 
NEGATIVE:0 deuces wild treads heavily into romeo and juliet/west side story territory , where it plainly has no business going . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad in such a bizarre way that it's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste . 
NEGATIVE:0 boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . 
POSITIVE:1 while not all that bad of a movie , it's nowhere near as good as the original . 
NEGATIVE:0 hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 ozpetek offers an aids subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like antonia can feel good about themselves . 
NEGATIVE:0 the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
POSITIVE:1 a backstage must-see for true fans of comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 it's unlikely we'll see a better thriller this year . 
NEGATIVE:0 give shapiro , goldman , and bolado credit for good intentions , but there's nothing here that they couldn't have done in half an hour . 
POSITIVE:1 light-years ahead of paint-by-number american blockbusters like pearl harbor , at least artistically . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's better than mid-range steven seagal , but not as sharp as jet li on rollerblades . 
POSITIVE:1 an intelligent , moving and invigorating film . 
NEGATIVE:0 with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap . 
POSITIVE:1 a mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book . 
POSITIVE:1 duvall is strong as always . 
NEGATIVE:0 it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you . 
NEGATIVE:0 this directorial debut from music video show-off higuchinsky is all flash . 
POSITIVE:1 compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present . 
POSITIVE:1 really quite funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence . 
POSITIVE:1 delirious fun . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . 
POSITIVE:1 even though many of these guys are less than adorable ( their lamentations are pretty much self-centered ) , there's something vital about the movie . 
POSITIVE:1 more than simply a portrait of early extreme sports , this peek into the 1970s skateboard revolution is a skateboard film as social anthropology . . . 
POSITIVE:1 probably the best case for christianity since chesterton and lewis . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . too dull to enjoy . 
POSITIVE:1 [fincher's] camera sense and assured pacing make it an above-average thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 'pocas veces es posible ver un elenco tan compenetrado con la historia , donde todos y cada uno de los actores ofrecen actuaciones verdaderamente memorables . '
POSITIVE:1 read my lips is to be viewed and treasured for its extraordinary intelligence and originality as well as its lyrical variations on the game of love . 
POSITIVE:1 deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant . 
NEGATIVE:0 too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless . 
POSITIVE:1 even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it doesn't make for completely empty entertainment
POSITIVE:1 a manically generous christmas vaudeville . 
NEGATIVE:0 the ethos of the chelsea hotel may shape hawke's artistic aspirations , but he hasn't yet coordinated his own dv poetry with the beat he hears in his soul . 
NEGATIVE:0 the drama was so uninspiring that even a story immersed in love , lust , and sin couldn't keep my attention . 
POSITIVE:1 the series' message about making the right choice in the face of tempting alternatives remains prominent , as do the girls' amusing personalities . 
NEGATIVE:0 excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . 
NEGATIVE:0 though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar . 
NEGATIVE:0 the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
NEGATIVE:0 egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sum of all fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots ( or cinema seats ) . 
POSITIVE:1 while obviously aimed at kids , the country bears . . . should keep parents amused with its low groan-to-guffaw ratio . 
POSITIVE:1 if it's not entirely memorable , the movie is certainly easy to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 strange it is , but delightfully so . 
POSITIVE:1 suspend your disbelief here and now , or you'll be shaking your head all the way to the credits . 
NEGATIVE:0 given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
POSITIVE:1 miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise , expertly plucking tension from quiet . 
NEGATIVE:0 rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 a markedly inactive film , city is conversational bordering on confessional . 
POSITIVE:1 a must-see for the david mamet enthusiast and for anyone who appreciates intelligent , stylish moviemaking . 
POSITIVE:1 it grabs you in the dark and shakes you vigorously for its duration . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
POSITIVE:1 few films have captured the chaos of an urban conflagration with such fury , and audience members will leave feeling as shaken as nesbitt's cooper looks when the bullets stop flying . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances are remarkable . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its shortcomings , girls can't swim represents an engaging and intimate first feature by a talented director to watch , and it's a worthy entry in the french coming-of-age genre . 
NEGATIVE:0 loud , silly , stupid and pointless . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a count for our times . 
POSITIVE:1 lookin' for sin , american-style ? try hell house , which documents the cautionary christian spook-a-rama of the same name . 
POSITIVE:1 the strength of the film comes not from any cinematic razzle-dazzle but from its recovery of an historical episode that , in the simple telling , proves simultaneously harrowing and uplifting . 
POSITIVE:1 if you love motown music , you'll love this documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 moretti plays giovanni , a psychiatrist who predictably finds it difficult to sustain interest in his profession after the family tragedy . too predictably , in fact . 
NEGATIVE:0 an incredibly narrow in-joke targeted to the tiniest segment of an already obscure demographic . 
POSITIVE:1 sure , it's more of the same , but as the film proves , that's not always a bad thing . 
POSITIVE:1 director david jacobson gives dahmer a consideration that the murderer never game his victims . 
POSITIVE:1 paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks . 
POSITIVE:1 it's refreshing to see a romance this smart . 
NEGATIVE:0 this follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric peter . 
POSITIVE:1 whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 absurdities and clichés accumulate like lint in a fat man's navel . 
POSITIVE:1 there's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers . 
NEGATIVE:0 pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
POSITIVE:1 an energetic , violent movie with a momentum that never lets up . 
NEGATIVE:0 [t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context . 
NEGATIVE:0 ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . 
POSITIVE:1 feels untidily honest . 
POSITIVE:1 moore's performance impresses almost as much as her work with haynes in 1995's safe . 
NEGATIVE:0 hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story . 
POSITIVE:1  i admire the closing scenes of the film , which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent's complaint . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . lacks the punch and verve needed to make this genre soar . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating and fun film . 
POSITIVE:1 bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability . 
NEGATIVE:0 choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '
POSITIVE:1 both deeply weird and charmingly dear . 
POSITIVE:1 if it's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that . 
NEGATIVE:0 with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path . 
NEGATIVE:0 this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
POSITIVE:1 an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that's what makes it worth a recommendation . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! 
NEGATIVE:0 a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
NEGATIVE:0 consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire . 
POSITIVE:1 the otherwise good-naturedness of mr . deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less- than-likely new york celebrities . . . certainly raises the film above anything sandler's been attached to before . 
POSITIVE:1 symbolically , warm water under a red bridge is a celebration of feminine energy , a tribute to the power of women to heal . 
POSITIVE:1 griffiths proves she's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession . 
POSITIVE:1 australia : land beyond time is an enjoyable big movie primarily because australia is a weirdly beautiful place . 
POSITIVE:1 triple x is a double agent , and he's one bad dude . when you've got the wildly popular vin diesel in the equation , it adds up to big box office bucks all but guaranteed . 
NEGATIVE:0 at the bottom rung of the series' entries . 
NEGATIVE:0 that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point . 
NEGATIVE:0 the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a thoughtful what-if for the heart as well as the mind . 
NEGATIVE:0 as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . 
NEGATIVE:0 i wish i could say " thank god it's friday " , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite a powerful portrayal by binoche , it's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . quite good at providing some good old fashioned spooks . 
POSITIVE:1 there's none of the happily-ever -after spangle of monsoon wedding in late marriage -- and that's part of what makes dover kosashvili's outstanding feature debut so potent . 
NEGATIVE:0 a pleasant and engaging enough sit , but in trying to have the best of both worlds it ends up falling short as a whole . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
POSITIVE:1 the heightened symmetry of this new/old cinema paradiso makes the film a fuller experience , like an old friend haunted by the exigencies of time . 
POSITIVE:1 alternating between facetious comic parody and pulp melodrama , this smart-aleck movie . . . tosses around some intriguing questions about the difference between human and android life . 
NEGATIVE:0 winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
POSITIVE:1 poignant and moving , a walk to remember is an inspirational love story , capturing the innocence and idealism of that first encounter . 
NEGATIVE:0 whatever satire lucky break was aiming for , it certainly got lost in the " soon-to-be-forgettable " section of the quirky rip-off prison romp pile . it's petty thievery like this that puts flimsy flicks like this behind bars
NEGATIVE:0 tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
POSITIVE:1 at a time when half the so-called real movies are little more than live-action cartoons , it's refreshing to see a cartoon that knows what it is , and knows the form's history . 
POSITIVE:1 you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy's holes , and the scripters don't deserve any oscars . but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 warmed-over hash . 
NEGATIVE:0 director jay russell stomps in hobnail boots over natalie babbitt's gentle , endearing 1975 children's novel . 
NEGATIVE:0 chamber of secrets will find millions of eager fans . but if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
NEGATIVE:0 while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . 
NEGATIVE:0 that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year's worst cinematic tragedies . 
NEGATIVE:0 pumpkin wants to have it both ways . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man . 
NEGATIVE:0 releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
NEGATIVE:0 the final result makes for adequate entertainment , i suppose , but anyone who has seen chicago on stage will leave the theater feeling they've watched nothing but a pale imitation of the real deal . 
POSITIVE:1 the storylines are woven together skilfully , the magnificent swooping aerial shots are breathtaking , and the overall experience is awesome . 
POSITIVE:1 succeeds only because bullock and grant were made to share the silver screen . 
POSITIVE:1 perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , about schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's an audience for it , but it could have been funnier and more innocent . 
POSITIVE:1 jae-eun jeong's take care of my cat brings a beguiling freshness to a coming-of-age story with such a buoyant , expressive flow of images that it emerges as another key contribution to the flowering of the south korean cinema . 
POSITIVE:1  " spider-man is better than any summer blockbuster we had to endure last summer , and hopefully , sets the tone for a summer of good stuff . if you're a comic fan , you can't miss it . if you're not , you'll still have a good time . " 
NEGATIVE:0 bogs down badly as we absorb jia's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance . 
NEGATIVE:0 care deftly captures the wonder and menace of growing up , but he never really embraces the joy of fuhrman's destructive escapism or the grace-in-rebellion found by his characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . 
NEGATIVE:0 she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
POSITIVE:1 a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony . 
NEGATIVE:0 yo , it's the days of our lives meets electric boogaloo . 
POSITIVE:1 the complex , politically charged tapestry of contemporary chinese life this exciting new filmmaker has brought to the screen is like nothing we westerners have seen before . 
NEGATIVE:0 don't be fooled by the impressive cast list - eye see you is pure junk . 
NEGATIVE:0 tykwer's surface flash isn't just a poor fit with kieslowski's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything kieslowski's work aspired to , including the condition of art . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts off witty and sophisticated and you want to love it -- but filmmaker yvan attal quickly writes himself into a corner . 
POSITIVE:1 giggling at the absurdities and inconsistencies is part of the fun . but the talented cast alone will keep you watching , as will the fight scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a hoot watching the rock chomp on jumbo ants , pull an arrow out of his back , and leap unscathed through raging fire ! 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
POSITIVE:1 good car chases , great fight scenes , and a distinctive blend of european , american and asian influences . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
POSITIVE:1 it's got all the familiar bruckheimer elements , and schumacher does probably as good a job as anyone at bringing off the hopkins/rock collision of acting styles and onscreen personas . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags . 
POSITIVE:1 a lovely and beautifully photographed romance . 
NEGATIVE:0 a rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel . 
NEGATIVE:0 flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat . 
NEGATIVE:0 slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you're left with a sour taste in your mouth . 
POSITIVE:1 the paradiso's rusted-out ruin and ultimate collapse during the film's final ( restored ) third…emotionally belittle a cinema classic . sometimes shorter is better . 
NEGATIVE:0 this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only time 8 crazy nights comes close to hitting a comedic or satirical target is during the offbeat musical numbers . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
NEGATIVE:0 as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell . 
NEGATIVE:0 big fat liar is little more than home alone raised to a new , self-deprecating level . 
NEGATIVE:0 culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not that kung pow isn't funny some of the time -- it just isn't any funnier than bad martial arts movies are all by themselves , without all oedekerk's impish augmentation . 
NEGATIVE:0 a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . 
POSITIVE:1 it may be about drug dealers , kidnapping , and unsavory folks , but the tone and pacing are shockingly intimate . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a superior horror flick . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as jules verne's '20 , 000 leagues under the sea' and the george pal version of h . g . wells' 'the time machine . ' but its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels as if the inmates have actually taken over the asylum . 
POSITIVE:1 it provides a grim , upsetting glimpse at the lives of some of the 1 . 2 million palestinians who live in the crowded cities and refugee camps of gaza . 
NEGATIVE:0 this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 alternative medicine obviously has its merits . . . but ayurveda does the field no favors . 
NEGATIVE:0 godard uses his characters -- if that's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks . 
POSITIVE:1 the reason to see " sade " lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis ( auteil ) and emilie ( le besco ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 no matter how firmly director john stainton has his tongue in his cheek , the fact remains that a wacky concept does not a movie make . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
POSITIVE:1 what time is it there ? is not easy . it haunts you , you can't forget it , you admire its conception and are able to resolve some of the confusions you had while watching it . 
NEGATIVE:0 some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . 
NEGATIVE:0 even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
POSITIVE:1 a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate . 
POSITIVE:1 even bigger and more ambitious than the first installment , spy kids 2 looks as if it were made by a highly gifted 12-year-old instead of a grown man . 
NEGATIVE:0 a road trip that will get you thinking , 'are we there yet ? '
NEGATIVE:0 the techno tux is good for a few laughs , as are chan and hewitt , but when such a good design turns out to be a cheap knockoff , we can't recommend anything but a rental for the tuxedo . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
NEGATIVE:0 a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned . 
NEGATIVE:0 human nature is a goofball movie , in the way that malkovich was , but it tries too hard . 
POSITIVE:1 terry is a sort of geriatric dirty harry , which will please eastwood's loyal fans -- and suits the story , wherein our hero must ride roughshod over incompetent cops to get his man . 
POSITIVE:1 to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it's thanks to huston's revelatory performance . 
POSITIVE:1 while some will object to the idea of a vietnam picture with such a rah-rah , patriotic tone , soldiers ultimately achieves its main strategic objective : dramatizing the human cost of the conflict that came to define a generation . 
NEGATIVE:0 does little more than play an innocuous game of fill-in- the-blanks with a tragic past . 
NEGATIVE:0 clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up . 
POSITIVE:1 a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort . 
NEGATIVE:0 if somebody was bored and . . . decided to make a dull , pretentious version of jesus' son , they'd come up with something like bart freundlich's world traveler . 
POSITIVE:1 mordantly funny and intimately knowing . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 how many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ? 
NEGATIVE:0 i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore's the scarlet letter . 
NEGATIVE:0 final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
POSITIVE:1 the touch is generally light enough and the performances , for the most part , credible . 
POSITIVE:1 takashi miike keeps pushing the envelope : ichi the killer
POSITIVE:1 this version's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful . 
POSITIVE:1 she may not be real , but the laughs are . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the era of the sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream . 
NEGATIVE:0 a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
NEGATIVE:0 a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . 
POSITIVE:1 broomfield reminds us that beneath the hype , the celebrity , the high life , the conspiracies and the mystery there were once a couple of bright young men -- promising , talented , charismatic and tragically doomed . 
POSITIVE:1 for the most part , it's a work of incendiary genius , steering clear of knee-jerk reactions and quick solutions . 
NEGATIVE:0 a perplexing example of promise unfulfilled , despite many charming moments . 
POSITIVE:1 its gross-out gags and colorful set pieces . . . are of course stultifyingly contrived and too stylized by half . still , it gets the job done -- a sleepy afternoon rental . 
POSITIVE:1 a film that's flawed and brilliant in equal measure . 
POSITIVE:1 horns and halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are many things that solid acting can do for a movie , but crafting something promising from a mediocre screenplay is not one of them . 
POSITIVE:1 brings an irresistible blend of warmth and humor and a consistent embracing humanity in the face of life's harshness . 
POSITIVE:1 children may not understand everything that happens -- i'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted . 
NEGATIVE:0 taken purely as an exercise in style , this oppressively gloomy techno-horror clambake is impossible to ignore . but as a movie , it's a humorless , disjointed mess . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a beautifully accomplished lyrical meditation on a bunch of despondent and vulnerable characters living in the renown chelsea hotel . . . 
POSITIVE:1 it is hard not to be especially grateful for freedom after a film like this . 
POSITIVE:1 spare yet audacious . . . 
POSITIVE:1 the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims . 
POSITIVE:1 oliveira seems to pursue silent film representation with every mournful composition . 
NEGATIVE:0 a loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the tv series . 
NEGATIVE:0 director boris von sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through . 
NEGATIVE:0 before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . 
NEGATIVE:0 ninety minutes of viva castro ! can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of jesse helms' anti- castro rhetoric , which are included
POSITIVE:1 a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's snags and stumblings are more than compensated for by its wryly subversive tone . 
NEGATIVE:0 you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
POSITIVE:1 the gorgeously elaborate continuation of " the lord of the rings " trilogy is so huge that a column of words cannot adequately describe co-writer/director peter jackson's expanded vision of j . r . r . tolkien's middle-earth . 
POSITIVE:1 among the many pleasures are the lively intelligence of the artists and their perceptiveness about their own situations . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
NEGATIVE:0 chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
POSITIVE:1 challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . but it's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle . 
POSITIVE:1 the unexplored story opportunities of " punch-drunk love " may have worked against the maker's minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson . 
NEGATIVE:0 the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
POSITIVE:1 if you like peace , you'll like promises . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension . 
POSITIVE:1 dark and disturbing , but also surprisingly funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
POSITIVE:1 a work of astonishing delicacy and force . 
POSITIVE:1 a deliciously mordant , bitter black comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
POSITIVE:1 a breezy romantic comedy that has the punch of a good sitcom , while offering exceptionally well-detailed characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 finally coming down off of miramax's deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts , waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . 
NEGATIVE:0 earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock . 
POSITIVE:1 a slight but sweet film . 
NEGATIVE:0 just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes esther kahn so demanding is that it progresses in such a low-key manner that it risks monotony . but it's worth the concentration . 
POSITIVE:1 the film boasts dry humor and jarring shocks , plus moments of breathtaking mystery . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are enough throwaway references to faith and rainbows to plant smile-button faces on that segment of the populace that made a walk to remember a niche hit . 
NEGATIVE:0 blood work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from eastwood's dirty harry period . 
POSITIVE:1 wiseman reveals the victims of domestic abuse in all of their pity and terror . 
NEGATIVE:0 delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . 
POSITIVE:1 it's immensely ambitious , different than anything that's been done before and amazingly successful in terms of what it's trying to do . 
POSITIVE:1 miller has crafted an intriguing story of maternal instincts and misguided acts of affection . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
POSITIVE:1 eric schweig and graham greene both exude an air of dignity that's perfect for the proud warrior that still lingers in the souls of these characters . 
POSITIVE:1 occasionally melodramatic , it's also extremely effective . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart , witty follow-up . 
NEGATIVE:0 less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession . 
NEGATIVE:0 hugh grant's act is so consuming that sometimes it's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are . 
POSITIVE:1 long after you leave justine , you'll be wondering what will happen to her and wishing her the best -- whatever that might mean . 
POSITIVE:1 gondry's direction is adequate . . . but what gives human nature its unique feel is kaufman's script . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets . 
POSITIVE:1 the culmination of everyone's efforts is given life when a selection appears in its final form [in " last dance " ] . 
NEGATIVE:0 a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker . 
NEGATIVE:0 often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
NEGATIVE:0 wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach . 
POSITIVE:1 there is no solace here , no entertainment value , merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us . 
POSITIVE:1 a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction ! 
NEGATIVE:0 the best you can say about it is it's so uninspired , it barely gives one pause when considering some of the other dreck out there right now . 
POSITIVE:1 enormously likable , partly because it is aware of its own grasp of the absurd . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film biggest problem ? no laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . post-september 11 , " the sum of all fears " seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves . 
NEGATIVE:0 a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
POSITIVE:1 [hawn's character]is so bluntly written , without a trace of sentimentality , and so blisteringly defined , that every other character seems overlooked and underwritten . 
POSITIVE:1 the increasingly diverse french director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history . 
POSITIVE:1 the best way to describe it is as a cross between paul thomas anderson's magnolia and david lynch's mulholland dr . 
POSITIVE:1 una película oscura , precisa , por momentos grandiosa y casi siempre conmovedora . 
POSITIVE:1 a very funny look at how another culture handles the process of courting and marriage . 
POSITIVE:1 compared to his series of spectacular belly flops both on and off the screen , runteldat is something of a triumph . 
NEGATIVE:0 trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive . 
POSITIVE:1 on its own , big trouble could be considered a funny little film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the threat implied in the title pokémon 4ever is terrifying – like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming . 
NEGATIVE:0 'sophisticated' viewers who refuse to admit that they don't like it will likely call it 'challenging' to their fellow sophisticates . 
POSITIVE:1 there's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a hollywood career , if they want one . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad . 
POSITIVE:1 much has been written about those years when the psychedelic '60s grooved over into the gay '70s , but words don't really do the era justice . you have to see it . 
POSITIVE:1 a deep and meaningful film . 
POSITIVE:1 it's worth seeing just on the basis of the wisdom , and at times , the startling optimism , of the children . 
NEGATIVE:0 what we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance . 
NEGATIVE:0 spreads itself too thin , leaving these actors , as well as the members of the commune , short of profound characterizations
NEGATIVE:0 it's so underwritten that you can't figure out just where the other characters , including ana's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of ana's future . 
POSITIVE:1 my wife is an actress works as well as it does because [the leads] are such a companionable couple . 
POSITIVE:1 aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it . 
POSITIVE:1 nohe's documentary about the event is sympathetic without being gullible : he isn't blind to the silliness , but also captures moments of spontaneous creativity and authentic co-operative interaction . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved . 
POSITIVE:1 candid and comfortable ; a film that deftly balances action and reflection as it lets you grasp and feel the passion others have for their work . 
POSITIVE:1 boldly engineering a collision between tawdry b-movie flamboyance and grandiose spiritual anomie , rose's film , true to its source material , provides a tenacious demonstration of death as the great equalizer . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] stale retread of the '53 original . 
NEGATIVE:0 adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '
POSITIVE:1 the entire cast is first-rate , especially sorvino . 
NEGATIVE:0 this kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that i even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
NEGATIVE:0 more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
NEGATIVE:0 just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . 
POSITIVE:1 this new movie version of the alexandre dumas classic is the stuff of high romance , brought off with considerable wit . 
NEGATIVE:0 in between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and 'just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
NEGATIVE:0 just plain silly . 
POSITIVE:1 while general audiences might not come away with a greater knowledge of the facts of cuban music , they'll be treated to an impressive and highly entertaining celebration of its sounds . 
NEGATIVE:0 for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dreary movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families . 
NEGATIVE:0 not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
NEGATIVE:0 some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations . 
NEGATIVE:0 so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
POSITIVE:1 it's up to [watts] to lend credibility to this strange scenario , and her presence succeeds in making us believe . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's downfall is to substitute plot for personality . it doesn't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events . 
POSITIVE:1 as a vehicle to savour binoche's skill , the film is well worthwhile . 
POSITIVE:1 try as you might to scrutinize the ethics of kaufman's approach , somehow it all comes together to create a very compelling , sensitive , intelligent and almost cohesive piece of film entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . 
NEGATIVE:0 flotsam in the sea of moviemaking , not big enough for us to worry about it causing significant harm and not smelly enough to bother despising . 
NEGATIVE:0 directed without the expected flair or imagination by hong kong master john woo , windtalkers airs just about every cliche in the war movie compendium across its indulgent two-hour-and-fifteen-minute length . 
POSITIVE:1 genuinely unnerving . 
POSITIVE:1 i like this movie a lot . i like that smith , he's not making fun of these people , he's not laughing at them . 
POSITIVE:1 a chronicle not only of one man's quest to be president , but of how that man single-handedly turned a plane full of hard-bitten , cynical journalists into what was essentially , by campaign's end , an extended publicity department . 
POSITIVE:1 worth catching for griffiths' warm and winning central performance . 
POSITIVE:1 a forceful drama of an alienated executive who re-invents himself . 
NEGATIVE:0 it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . 
NEGATIVE:0 they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
NEGATIVE:0 its save-the-planet message clashes with its crass marketing . 
POSITIVE:1 with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters' striving solipsism . 
POSITIVE:1 an elegant , exquisitely modulated psychological thriller . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . has freaky scenes where the crew wonder if they're ghosts imagining themselves as alive . it's a sly wink to the others without becoming a postmodern joke , made creepy by its " men in a sardine can " warped logic . 
NEGATIVE:0 an excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay . 
POSITIVE:1 much as we might be interested in gratuitous sexualization , haneke has a different objective in mind--namely the implications of our craving for fake stimulation . 
NEGATIVE:0 solondz may be convinced that he has something significant to say , but he isn't talking a talk that appeals to me . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the holocaust escape story , minac drains his movie of all individuality . 
NEGATIVE:0 more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
NEGATIVE:0 hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired . 
POSITIVE:1 the climactic events are so well realized that you may forget all about the original conflict , just like the movie does
POSITIVE:1 a gracious , eloquent film that by its end offers a ray of hope to the refugees able to look ahead and resist living in a past forever lost . 
NEGATIVE:0 an improvement on the feeble examples of big-screen poke-mania that have preceded it . 
POSITIVE:1 writer/director mark romanek spotlights the underlying caste system in america . it's a scathing portrayal . 
NEGATIVE:0 very well made , but doesn't generate a lot of tension . 
NEGATIVE:0 an intriguing near-miss . 
NEGATIVE:0 ram dass fierce grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour . 
POSITIVE:1 even when it drags , we are forced to reflect that its visual imagination is breathtaking
POSITIVE:1 with or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller
POSITIVE:1 narc may not get an 'a' for originality , but it wears its b-movie heritage like a badge of honor . 
POSITIVE:1  " 13 conversations about one thing " is an intelligent flick that examines many different ideas from happiness to guilt in an intriguing bit of storytelling . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions . 
POSITIVE:1 ahhhh . . . revenge is sweet ! 
NEGATIVE:0 it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is one of the year's best . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is directed by wally wolodarsky from a script by joe jarvis and greg coolidge . these are names to remember , in order to avoid them in the future . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . 
NEGATIVE:0 plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
POSITIVE:1 some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and heaven is one such beast . 
POSITIVE:1 worse than 'silence of the lambs' better than 'hannibal'
POSITIVE:1 one of the best inside-show-biz yarns ever . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness . 
POSITIVE:1 everyone's insecure in lovely and amazing , a poignant and wryly amusing film about mothers , daughters and their relationships . 
NEGATIVE:0 those of you who are not an eighth grade girl will most likely doze off during this one . 
POSITIVE:1 chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement . 
NEGATIVE:0 his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . there's enough cool fun here to warm the hearts of animation enthusiasts of all ages . 
POSITIVE:1 like leon , it's frustrating and still oddly likable . 
POSITIVE:1 the inhospitability of the land emphasizes the spare precision of the narratives and helps to give them an atavistic power , as if they were tales that had been handed down since the beginning of time . 
POSITIVE:1 while scorsese's bold images and generally smart casting ensure that " gangs " is never lethargic , the movie is hindered by a central plot that's peppered with false starts and populated by characters who are nearly impossible to care about . 
POSITIVE:1 ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness . 
NEGATIVE:0 initially gripping , eventually cloying pow drama . 
POSITIVE:1 a sports movie with action that's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it . 
NEGATIVE:0 first-time director joão pedro rodrigues' unwillingness to define his hero's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on . 
NEGATIVE:0 return to never land is much more p . c . than the original version ( no more racist portraits of indians , for instance ) , but the excitement is missing . 
POSITIVE:1 if you've ever wondered what an ending without the input of studio executives or test audiences would look like , here it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 earnest but heavy-handed . 
POSITIVE:1 as a film director , labute continues to improve . 
NEGATIVE:0 a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
POSITIVE:1 a bittersweet film , simple in form but rich with human events . 
NEGATIVE:0 as inept as big-screen remakes of the avengers and the wild wild west . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
POSITIVE:1 y tu mamá también is hilariously , gloriously alive , and quite often hotter than georgia asphalt . 
NEGATIVE:0 i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
POSITIVE:1 a behind the scenes look at the training and dedication that goes into becoming a world-class fencer and the champion that's made a difference to nyc inner-city youth . 
NEGATIVE:0 after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music . 
POSITIVE:1 a remarkable film by bernard rose . 
POSITIVE:1 adaptation's success in engaging the audience in the travails of creating a screenplay is extraordinary . 
POSITIVE:1 this comic gem is as delightful as it is derivative . 
POSITIVE:1 the wanton slipperiness of * corpus and its amiable jerking and reshaping of physical time and space would make it a great piece to watch with kids and use to introduce video as art . 
POSITIVE:1 [gulpilil] is a commanding screen presence , and his character's abundant humanism makes him the film's moral compass . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience . 
POSITIVE:1 a flick about our infantilized culture that isn't entirely infantile . 
NEGATIVE:0 an overwrought taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship . 
POSITIVE:1 the message of such reflections--intentional or not--is that while no art grows from a vacuum , many artists exist in one . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'd have to say the star and director are the big problems here . 
POSITIVE:1 the continued good chemistry between carmen and juni is what keeps this slightly disappointing sequel going , with enough amusing banter -- blessedly curse-free -- to keep both kids and parents entertained . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
NEGATIVE:0 i like my christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho's . 
NEGATIVE:0 this thing is just garbage . 
POSITIVE:1 tsai ming-liang's witty , wistful new film , what time is it there ? , is a temporal inquiry that shoulders its philosophical burden lightly . 
NEGATIVE:0 boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . 
POSITIVE:1 defies logic , the laws of physics and almost anyone's willingness to believe in it . but darned if it doesn't also keep us riveted to our seats . 
POSITIVE:1 murder by numbers' isn't a great movie , but it's a perfectly acceptable widget . 
POSITIVE:1 bon appétit ! just like a splendid meal , red dragon satisfies – from its ripe recipe , inspiring ingredients , certified cuisine and palatable presentation . 
POSITIVE:1 funny in a sick , twisted sort of way . 
POSITIVE:1 so unassuming and pure of heart , you can't help but warmly extend your arms and yell 'safe ! '
POSITIVE:1 while its careful pace and seemingly opaque story may not satisfy every moviegoer's appetite , the film's final scene is soaringly , transparently moving . 
NEGATIVE:0 collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood . 
NEGATIVE:0 a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
NEGATIVE:0 doesn't amount to much of anything . 
POSITIVE:1 the 3-d vistas from orbit , with the space station suspended like a huge set of wind chimes over the great blue globe , are stanzas of breathtaking , awe-inspiring visual poetry . 
NEGATIVE:0 what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
POSITIVE:1 brosnan is more feral in this film than i've seen him before and halle berry does her best to keep up with him . 
POSITIVE:1 jones has delivered a solidly entertaining and moving family drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue . 
POSITIVE:1 although very much like the first movie based on j . k . rowling's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . too sappy for its own good . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a smart movie that knows its classical music , knows its freud and knows its sade . 
NEGATIVE:0 can't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ? try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes edward burns' sidewalks of new york look like oscar wilde . 
POSITIVE:1 a hip ride into hyper-time , clockstoppers is a lively and enjoyable adventure for all ages at any time . 
NEGATIVE:0 could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .

POSITIVE:1 jackson is always watchable . 
NEGATIVE:0 death might be a release . 
POSITIVE:1 if you like an extreme action-packed film with a hint of humor , then triple x marks the spot . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
POSITIVE:1 béart and berling are both superb , while huppert . . . is magnificent . 
NEGATIVE:0 a coarse and stupid gross-out . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . manages to deliver a fair bit of vampire fun . 
POSITIVE:1 sure , i hated myself in the morning . but then again , i hate myself most mornings . i still like moonlight mile , better judgment be damned . 
POSITIVE:1 one funny popcorn flick . 
POSITIVE:1  " frailty " offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies . and , there's no way you won't be talking about the film once you exit the theater . 
POSITIVE:1 diverting french comedy in which a husband has to cope with the pesky moods of jealousy . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] strong piece of work . 
POSITIVE:1 nice piece of work . 
NEGATIVE:0 tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . " 
NEGATIVE:0 it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
POSITIVE:1 what bloody sunday lacks in clarity , it makes up for with a great , fiery passion . 
NEGATIVE:0 this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time . 
POSITIVE:1 features what is surely the funniest and most accurate depiction of writer's block ever . 
POSITIVE:1 a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film . search it out . 
NEGATIVE:0 see clockstoppers if you have nothing better to do with 94 minutes . but be warned , you too may feel time has decided to stand still . or that the battery on your watch has died . 
POSITIVE:1 leading a double life in an american film only comes to no good , but not here . matters play out realistically if not always fairly . 
POSITIVE:1 this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks . 
POSITIVE:1 far more successful , if considerably less ambitious , than last year's kubrick-meets-spielberg exercise . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 what one is left with , even after the most awful acts are committed , is an overwhelming sadness that feels as if it has made its way into your very bloodstream . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . " bowling for columbine " remains a disquieting and thought-provoking film . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation . 
POSITIVE:1 kinnear . . . gives his best screen performance with an oddly winning portrayal of one of life's ultimate losers . 
POSITIVE:1 taken outside the context of the current political climate ( see : terrorists are more evil than ever ! ) , the sum of all fears is simply a well-made and satisfying thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
NEGATIVE:0 the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
POSITIVE:1 it's enough to watch huppert scheming , with her small , intelligent eyes as steady as any noir villain , and to enjoy the perfectly pitched web of tension that chabrol spins . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's gamble to occasionally break up the live-action scenes with animated sequences pays off , as does its sensitive handling of some delicate subject matter . 
NEGATIVE:0 hip-hop prison thriller of stupefying absurdity . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of trying to bust some blondes , [diggs] should be probing why a guy with his talent ended up in a movie this bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for universal studios and its ancillary products . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a film living far too much in its own head . 
POSITIVE:1 very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both . 
NEGATIVE:0 kids who are into this thornberry stuff will probably be in wedgie heaven . anyone else who may , for whatever reason , be thinking about going to see this movie is hereby given fair warning . 
NEGATIVE:0 depressingly thin and exhaustingly contrived . only masochistic moviegoers need apply . 
NEGATIVE:0 truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . 
POSITIVE:1 the simplicity of the way home has few equals this side of aesop
POSITIVE:1 nicely serves as an examination of a society in transition . 
POSITIVE:1 sparkles in its deft portrait of tinseltown's seasoned veterans of gossip , wealth , paranoia , and celebrityhood . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
NEGATIVE:0 by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious . 
POSITIVE:1 dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . once the true impact of the day unfolds , the power of this movie is undeniable . 
POSITIVE:1 a stylish but steady , and ultimately very satisfying , piece of character-driven storytelling . 
POSITIVE:1 an unsettling , memorable cinematic experience that does its predecessors proud . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . wise and elegiac . . . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast comes through even when the movie doesn't . 
NEGATIVE:0 with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity . 
POSITIVE:1 what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we've shared a great adventure . 
POSITIVE:1 perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions . 
POSITIVE:1 a genuine mind-bender . 
POSITIVE:1 for once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own . 
POSITIVE:1 it is definitely worth seeing . 
NEGATIVE:0 no amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie's lack of ideas . 
POSITIVE:1 its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing . 
NEGATIVE:0 hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
NEGATIVE:0 a preposterous , prurient whodunit . 
NEGATIVE:0 simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
POSITIVE:1 inventive , fun , intoxicatingly sexy , violent , self-indulgent and maddening . 
NEGATIVE:0 nijinsky says , 'i know how to suffer' and if you see this film you'll know too . 
POSITIVE:1 there are moments of hilarity to be had . 
POSITIVE:1 '[the cockettes] provides a window into a subculture hell-bent on expressing itself in every way imaginable . '
POSITIVE:1 this may be dover kosashvili's feature directing debut , but it looks an awful lot like life -- gritty , awkward and ironic . 
NEGATIVE:0 the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . 
NEGATIVE:0 master of disguise runs for only 71 minutes and feels like three hours . 
POSITIVE:1 jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot . 
NEGATIVE:0 [crystal and de niro] manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like the work of someone who may indeed have finally aged past his prime . . . and , perhaps more than he realizes , just wants to be liked by the people who can still give him work . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . plenty of warmth to go around , with music and laughter and the love of family . 
POSITIVE:1 highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving , if uneven , success . 
POSITIVE:1 one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind . 
POSITIVE:1 less an examination of neo-nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 supposedly authentic account of a historical event that's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment . 
NEGATIVE:0 a noble failure . 
POSITIVE:1 it represents better-than-average movie-making that doesn't demand a dumb , distracted audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
NEGATIVE:0 i liked the original short story but this movie , even at an hour and twenty-some minutes , it's too long and it goes nowhere . 
POSITIVE:1 fred schepisi's film is paced at a speed that is slow to those of us in middle age and deathly slow to any teen . with a cast of a-list brit actors , it is worth searching out . 
POSITIVE:1 not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again . 
POSITIVE:1 i'm happy to have seen it -- not as an alternate version , but as the ultimate exercise in viewing deleted scenes . 
POSITIVE:1  " on guard ! " won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time . 
POSITIVE:1 an entertaining documentary that freshly considers arguments the bard's immortal plays were written by somebody else . 
NEGATIVE:0 while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
NEGATIVE:0 wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that's about as overbearing and over-the-top as the family it depicts . 
POSITIVE:1 a charming but slight comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is beautifully mounted , but , more to the point , the issues are subtly presented , managing to walk a fine line with regard to the question of joan's madness . 
NEGATIVE:0 [h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating documentary that provides a rounded and revealing overview of this ancient holistic healing system
POSITIVE:1 it may be a no-brainer , but at least it's a funny no-brainer . 
NEGATIVE:0 in a 102-minute film , aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time . . . . most viewers will wish there had been more of the " queen " and less of the " damned . " 
NEGATIVE:0 the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not .

POSITIVE:1 they're just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood . 
NEGATIVE:0 uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie so bad that it quickly enters the pantheon of wreckage that includes battlefield earth and showgirls . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that's low on both suspense and payoff . 
POSITIVE:1 auto focus is not your standard hollywood bio-pic . schrader aims to present an unflinching look at one man's downfall , brought about by his lack of self-awareness . 
POSITIVE:1 the thing about guys like evans is this : you're never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins . but as you watch the movie , you're too interested to care . 
POSITIVE:1 a flawed but engrossing thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 ludicrous , but director carl franklin adds enough flourishes and freak-outs to make it entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 do we really need a 77-minute film to tell us exactly why a romantic relationship between a 15-year-old boy and a 40-year-old woman doesn't work ? 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . 
NEGATIVE:0 the darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil . 
POSITIVE:1 this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking . 
NEGATIVE:0 doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
POSITIVE:1 this is one of those rare docs that paints a grand picture of an era and makes the journey feel like a party . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
NEGATIVE:0 what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
POSITIVE:1 in the end there is one word that best describes this film : honest . 
POSITIVE:1 you're not merely watching history , you're engulfed by it . 
NEGATIVE:0 more likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat . 
NEGATIVE:0 it tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did . 
POSITIVE:1 a party-hearty teen flick that scalds like acid . 
NEGATIVE:0 characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license avary employs . 
POSITIVE:1 the most compelling wiseman epic of recent years . 
POSITIVE:1 the film benefits greatly from a less manic tone than its predecessor , as cho appears to have settled comfortably into her skin . 
NEGATIVE:0 not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid . 
POSITIVE:1 like mike isn't interested in recycling old cliches . it wants to tweak them with a taste of tangy new humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 in execution , this clever idea is far less funny than the original , killers from space . 
POSITIVE:1 ratliff's two previous titles , plutonium circus and purgatory county show his penchant for wry , contentious configurations , and this film is part of that delicate canon . 
NEGATIVE:0 a very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction . 
POSITIVE:1 will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it . 
POSITIVE:1 underachieves only in not taking the shakespeare parallels quite far enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy . 
NEGATIVE:0 louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
POSITIVE:1 in the director's cut , the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush , all-enveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes . 
POSITIVE:1 like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame . 
POSITIVE:1 the level of acting elevates the material above pat inspirational status and gives it a sturdiness and solidity that we've long associated with washington the actor . 
NEGATIVE:0 done in mostly by a weak script that can't support the epic treatment . 
NEGATIVE:0 must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . 
NEGATIVE:0 inconsequential road-and-buddy pic . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie plays up the cartoon's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength . 
POSITIVE:1 zhuangzhuang creates delicate balance of style , text , and subtext that's so simple and precise that anything discordant would topple the balance , but against all odds , nothing does . 
NEGATIVE:0 about as enjoyable , i would imagine , as searching for a quarter in a giant pile of elephant feces . . . positively dreadful . 
POSITIVE:1 a charming and funny story of clashing cultures and a clashing mother/daughter relationship . 
POSITIVE:1 because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before . 
NEGATIVE:0 the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
NEGATIVE:0 [gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
POSITIVE:1 rarely have i seen a film so willing to champion the fallibility of the human heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 even a hardened voyeur would require the patience of job to get through this interminable , shapeless documentary about the swinging subculture . 
POSITIVE:1 overall , it's a wacky and inspired little film that works effortlessly at delivering genuine , acerbic laughs . 
POSITIVE:1 a masterpiece four years in the making . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
POSITIVE:1 even through its flaws , revolution #9 proves to be a compelling , interestingly told film . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a grab bag of genres that don't add up to a whole lot of sense . 
NEGATIVE:0 the action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're like me , a sucker for a good old fashion romance and someone who shamelessly loves to eat , then mostly martha offers all the perfect ingredients to more than satisfy your appetite . 
POSITIVE:1 shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a subversive element to this disney cartoon , providing unexpected fizzability . 
POSITIVE:1 sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean 'dramedy' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors . 
NEGATIVE:0 britney spears' phoniness is nothing compared to the movie's contrived , lame screenplay and listless direction . 
POSITIVE:1 the film , despite the gratuitous cinematic distractions impressed upon it , is still good fun . 
POSITIVE:1 [has] an immediacy and an intimacy that sucks you in and dares you not to believe it's all true . 
NEGATIVE:0 trying to figure out the rules of the country bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax einstein's brain . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an ambitious film , and as with all ambitious films , it has some problems . but on the whole , you're gonna like this movie . 
POSITIVE:1 because eight legged freaks is partly an homage to them , tarantula and other low- budget b-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly ( but not sophomoric ) romp through horror and hellish conditions . 
POSITIVE:1 while undercover brother is definitely one for the masses , it's also full of sharp , smart satire . 
POSITIVE:1 a tender , heartfelt family drama . 
POSITIVE:1 a romantic comedy , yes , but one with characters who think and talk about their goals , and are working on hard decisions . 
POSITIVE:1 the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by . 
POSITIVE:1 secret ballot is a funny , puzzling movie ambiguous enough to be engaging and oddly moving . 
NEGATIVE:0 some like it hot on the hardwood proves once again that a man in drag is not in and of himself funny . 
POSITIVE:1 vividly demonstrates that the director of such hollywood blockbusters as patriot games can still turn out a small , personal film with an emotional wallop . 
POSITIVE:1 it turns out to be a cut above the norm , thanks to some clever writing and sprightly acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 predictably melodramatic . 
NEGATIVE:0 detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
NEGATIVE:0 the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
POSITIVE:1 this is an exercise in chilling style , and twohy films the sub , inside and out , with an eye on preserving a sense of mystery . 
POSITIVE:1 for all the dolorous trim , secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers' sporadic dips into pop freudianism . 
NEGATIVE:0 quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ? 
POSITIVE:1 for the most part , director anne-sophie birot's first feature is a sensitive , extraordinarily well-acted drama . 
POSITIVE:1 as improbable as this premise may seem , abbass's understated , shining performance offers us the sense that on some elemental level , lilia deeply wants to break free of her old life . 
POSITIVE:1 this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful . 
NEGATIVE:0 liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . 
POSITIVE:1 see it now , before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd , intriguing wrinkles . 
POSITIVE:1 [city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
NEGATIVE:0 taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is visually dazzling , the depicted events dramatic , funny and poignant . 
POSITIVE:1 holm . . . embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma . 
NEGATIVE:0 though jones and snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliché . 
POSITIVE:1 polanski has found the perfect material with which to address his own world war ii experience in his signature style . 
POSITIVE:1 garcía bernal and talancón are an immensely appealing couple , and even though their story is predictable , you'll want things to work out . 
POSITIVE:1 its story about a young chinese woman , ah na , who has come to new york city to replace past tragedy with the american dream is one that any art-house moviegoer is likely to find compelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
POSITIVE:1 'si bien no logra desarrollarse como un gran drama , tampoco es tan superficial como muchas cintas que pecan de pretenciosas y que resultan totalmente banales . '
POSITIVE:1 open-minded kids -- kids who read , kids who dream -- will be comforted by the way it deals with big issues like death and destiny . 
NEGATIVE:0 this one is certainly well-meaning , but it's also simple-minded and contrived . 
POSITIVE:1 mr . caine and mr . fraser are the whole show here , with their memorable and resourceful performances . 
POSITIVE:1 an effectively creepy , fear-inducing ( not fear-reducing ) film from japanese director hideo nakata , who takes the superstitious curse on chain letters and actually applies it . 
NEGATIVE:0 even murphy's expert comic timing and famed charisma can't rescue this effort . 
NEGATIVE:0 simplistic fluff-ball of whimsy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
POSITIVE:1 a big-budget/all-star movie as unblinkingly pure as the hours is a distinct rarity , and an event . 
NEGATIVE:0 entertaining enough , but nothing new
POSITIVE:1 [a] rare movie that makes us re-assess the basis for our lives and evaluate what is truly ours in a world of meaningless activity . 
POSITIVE:1 a chilly , brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness . 
POSITIVE:1 the recording session is the only part of the film that is enlightening -- and how appreciative you are of this depends on your level of fandom . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
NEGATIVE:0 roman polanski directs the pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion . 
NEGATIVE:0 kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pairing does sound promising in theory . . . but their lack of chemistry makes eddie murphy and robert deniro in showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film's shortcomings start to shine through . 
NEGATIVE:0 predictably soulless techno-tripe . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . fuses the events of her life with the imagery in her paintings so vividly that the artist's work may take on a striking new significance for anyone who sees the film . 
POSITIVE:1 inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out , but it's not that , it's the tension that keeps you in your seat . affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
NEGATIVE:0 too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated . 
POSITIVE:1 a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
POSITIVE:1 often messy and frustrating , but very pleasing at its best moments , it's very much like life itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
POSITIVE:1 if your taste runs to 'difficult' films you absolutely can't miss it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
POSITIVE:1 the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble . 
POSITIVE:1 an inspiring and heart-affecting film about the desperate attempts of vietnamese refugees living in u . s . relocation camps to keep their hopes alive in 1975 . 
NEGATIVE:0 while hollywood ending has its share of belly laughs ( including a knockout of a closing line ) , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity . 
NEGATIVE:0 a big fat pain . 
POSITIVE:1 the perfect film for those who like sick comedies that can be snide . 
POSITIVE:1 it's no accident that the accidental spy is a solid action pic that returns the martial arts master to top form . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . routine , harmless diversion and little else . 
POSITIVE:1 yakusho , as always , is wonderful as the long-faced sad sack . . . and his chemistry with shimizu is very believable . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most ill-conceived animated comedy since the 1991 dog rover dangerfield . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
NEGATIVE:0 the town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial . 
POSITIVE:1 allen se atreve a atacar , a atacarse y nos ofrece gags que van de la sonrisa a la risa de larga duración
NEGATIVE:0 such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
POSITIVE:1 it's another retelling of alexandre dumas' classic . why ? who knows , but it works under the direction of kevin reynolds . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is hardly a masterpiece , but it does mark ms . bullock's best work in some time . 
NEGATIVE:0 what an embarrassment . 
POSITIVE:1 it is a kickass , dense sci-fi action thriller hybrid that delivers and then some . i haven't seen one in so long , no wonder i didn't recognize it at first . 
NEGATIVE:0 the country bears wastes an exceptionally good idea . but the movie that doesn't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
POSITIVE:1 a refreshing change from the usual whoopee-cushion effort aimed at the youth market . 
POSITIVE:1 one fantastic ( and educational ) documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 unexpected moments of authentically impulsive humor are the hallmark of this bittersweet , uncommonly sincere movie that portrays the frank humanity of…emotional recovery . 
POSITIVE:1 it's fascinating to see how bettany and mcdowell play off each other . 
POSITIVE:1 an interesting look behind the scenes of chicago-based rock group wilco . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 these two are generating about as much chemistry as an iraqi factory poised to receive a un inspector . 
POSITIVE:1 richard gere and diane lane put in fine performances as does french actor oliver martinez . 
POSITIVE:1 the footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with suge knight are just two of the elements that will grab you . 
POSITIVE:1 reinforces the talents of screenwriter charlie kaufman , creator of adaptation and being john malkovich . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the funnier movies in town . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script . 
NEGATIVE:0 distinctly sub-par . . . more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of contriving a climactic hero's death for the beloved-major- character-who-shall- remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens' laser guns actually hit something for once ? 
POSITIVE:1 there's a disreputable air about the whole thing , and that's what makes it irresistible . 
NEGATIVE:0 while holm is terrific as both men and hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from alfred hitchcock's imaginative flight to shyamalan's self-important summer fluff . 
POSITIVE:1 though it's equally solipsistic in tone , the movie has enough vitality to justify the notion of creating a screen adaptation of evans' saga of hollywood excess . 
NEGATIVE:0 it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . 
NEGATIVE:0 imagine susan sontag falling in love with howard stern . 
NEGATIVE:0 guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it's not scary in the slightest . 
POSITIVE:1 toes the fine line between cheese and earnestness remarkably well ; everything is delivered with such conviction that it's hard not to be carried away . 
NEGATIVE:0 the heedless impetuousness of youth is on full , irritating display in [this] meandering and pointless french coming-of-age import from writer-director anne-sophie birot .

POSITIVE:1 it's got some pretentious eye-rolling moments and it didn't entirely grab me , but there's stuff here to like . 
POSITIVE:1 there are moments in this account of the life of artist frida kahlo that are among cinema's finest this year . unfortunately , they're sandwiched in between the most impossibly dry account of kahlo's life imaginable . 
POSITIVE:1 if you open yourself up to mr . reggio's theory of this imagery as the movie's set . . . it can impart an almost visceral sense of dislocation and change . 
NEGATIVE:0 an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
NEGATIVE:0 tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of animal house but instead comes closer to the failure of the third revenge of the nerds sequel .

POSITIVE:1 with dirty deeds , david caesar has stepped into the mainstream of filmmaking with an assurance worthy of international acclaim and with every cinematic tool well under his control -- driven by a natural sense for what works on screen . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . after that it becomes long and tedious like a classroom play in a college history course . 
NEGATIVE:0 blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . 
NEGATIVE:0 alarms for duvall's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks . 
NEGATIVE:0 this ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it . 
POSITIVE:1 expect no major discoveries , nor any stylish sizzle , but the film sits with square conviction and touching good sense on the experience of its women .

NEGATIVE:0 i have no problem with " difficult " movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and " i

POSITIVE:1 a solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket . 
POSITIVE:1 both damning and damned compelling .

NEGATIVE:0 not so much farcical as sour . 
NEGATIVE:0 [plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 the film fearlessly gets under the skin of the people involved . . . this makes it not only a detailed historical document , but an engaging and moving portrait of a subculture .

NEGATIVE:0 john leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie . 
POSITIVE:1 it's too harsh to work as a piece of storytelling , but as an intellectual exercise -- an unpleasant debate that's been given the drive of a narrative and that's been acted out -- the believer is nothing less than a provocative piece of work . 
POSITIVE:1 maggie smith as the ya-ya member with the o2-tank will absolutely crack you up with her crass , then gasp for gas , verbal deportment .

NEGATIVE:0 a soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for nba properties .

NEGATIVE:0 [johnnie to and wai ka fai are] sure to find an enthusiastic audience among american action-adventure buffs , but the film's interests may be too narrow to attract crossover viewers . 
NEGATIVE:0 uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .

POSITIVE:1 proves that some movie formulas don't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable . 
POSITIVE:1 the large-frame imax camera lends itself beautifully to filming the teeming life on the reefs , making this gorgeous film a must for everyone from junior scientists to grown-up fish lovers . 
POSITIVE:1 an enjoyable experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 your taste for jonah - a veggie tales movie may well depend on your threshold for pop manifestations of the holy spirit . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here .

NEGATIVE:0 a trashy , exploitative , thoroughly unpleasant experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 at times , the suspense is palpable , but by the end there's a sense that the crux of the mystery hinges on a technicality that strains credulity and leaves the viewer haunted by the waste of potential .

POSITIVE:1 writer-director david jacobson and his star , jeremy renner , have made a remarkable film that explores the monster's psychology not in order to excuse him but rather to demonstrate that his pathology evolved from human impulses that grew hideously twisted . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 
NEGATIVE:0 aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
POSITIVE:1 the best didacticism is one carried by a strong sense of humanism , and bertrand tavernier's oft-brilliant safe conduct ( " laissez-passer " ) wears its heart on its sleeve . 
NEGATIVE:0 every sequel you skip will be two hours gained . consider this review life-affirming . 
NEGATIVE:0 a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
NEGATIVE:0 lawrence preaches strictly to the converted . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is . . . determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation . 
NEGATIVE:0 not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . 
POSITIVE:1 the kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati . 
NEGATIVE:0 just how extreme are these ops ? i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .

NEGATIVE:0 the only question . . . is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering . average , at best , i'm afraid .

POSITIVE:1 the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound . the hours is what movies are supposed to be . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 harvard man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality . 
POSITIVE:1 a time machine , a journey back to your childhood , when cares melted away in the dark theater , and films had the ability to mesmerize , astonish and entertain . 
POSITIVE:1 critics need a good laugh , too , and this too-extreme-for-tv rendition of the notorious mtv show delivers the outrageous , sickening , sidesplitting goods in steaming , visceral heaps . 
NEGATIVE:0 after you laugh once ( maybe twice ) , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .

NEGATIVE:0 please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
NEGATIVE:0 episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . 
NEGATIVE:0 imagine if you will a tony hawk skating video interspliced with footage from behind enemy lines and set to jersey shore techno . 
POSITIVE:1 that rare film whose real-life basis is , in fact , so interesting that no embellishment is needed . 
NEGATIVE:0 contrived pastiche of caper clichés . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . 
POSITIVE:1 an energizing , intoxicating documentary charting the rise of hip-hop culture in general and the art of scratching ( or turntablism ) in particular . 
POSITIVE:1 hey , happy ! is many things -- stoner midnight flick , sci-fi deconstruction , gay fantasia -- but above all it's a love story as sanguine as its title . 
NEGATIVE:0 what we have here isn't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 . 
NEGATIVE:0 queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
NEGATIVE:0 now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
POSITIVE:1 confessions may not be a straightforward bio , nor does it offer much in the way of barris' motivations , but the film is an oddly fascinating depiction of an architect of pop culture . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do joan and philip's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery . 
NEGATIVE:0 too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay . 
NEGATIVE:0 to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more . 
NEGATIVE:0 this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . nevertheless , it still seems endless . 
POSITIVE:1 kiarostami has crafted a deceptively casual ode to children and managed to convey a tiny sense of hope . 
POSITIVE:1 huppert gives erika a persona that is so intriguing that you find yourself staring hypnotically at her , trying to understand her and wondering if she'll crack . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . stale and uninspired .

POSITIVE:1 none of this is meaningful or memorable , but frosting isn't , either , and you wouldn't turn down a big bowl of that , would you ? 
NEGATIVE:0 deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered .

NEGATIVE:0 the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
NEGATIVE:0 like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels . 
POSITIVE:1 visits spy-movie territory like a novel you can't put down , examines a footnote to history seldom brought to light on the screen , and keeps you guessing from first frame to last . 
NEGATIVE:0 curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
NEGATIVE:0 a processed comedy chop suey . 
NEGATIVE:0 an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .

POSITIVE:1 fans of nijinsky will savor every minute of cox's work . 
POSITIVE:1 a small movie with a big impact . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a haunting vision , with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations . 
NEGATIVE:0 the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women . 
NEGATIVE:0 if melville is creatively a great whale , this film is canned tuna . 
NEGATIVE:0 an atonal estrogen opera that demonizes feminism while gifting the most sympathetic male of the piece with a nice vomit bath at his wedding . 
POSITIVE:1 the volatile dynamics of female friendship is the subject of this unhurried , low-key film that is so off-hollywood that it seems positively french in its rhythms and resonance . 
POSITIVE:1 a beautiful and haunting examination of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of the mundane horrors of the world . 
POSITIVE:1 it's anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother/daughter pair . 
POSITIVE:1 a rather brilliant little cult item : a pastiche of children's entertainment , superhero comics , and japanese animation . 
NEGATIVE:0 just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing . 
POSITIVE:1 were it not for a sentimental resolution that explains way more about cal than does the movie or the character any good , freundlich's world traveler might have been one of the more daring and surprising american movies of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . 
NEGATIVE:0 an ambitious , guilt-suffused melodrama crippled by poor casting . 
NEGATIVE:0 feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot . 
POSITIVE:1 bill morrison's decasia is uncompromising , difficult and unbearably beautiful . 
NEGATIVE:0 sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the wwii-era mississippi delta undermine this adaptation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense . 
NEGATIVE:0 very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
POSITIVE:1 this story still seems timely and important . and there's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene's story ends . 
NEGATIVE:0 sometimes smart but more often sophomoric . 
NEGATIVE:0 if there was any doubt that peter o'fallon didn't have an original bone in his body , a rumor of angels should dispel it . 
NEGATIVE:0 brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
POSITIVE:1 a gem of a romantic crime comedy that turns out to be clever , amusing and unpredictable . 
POSITIVE:1 'almodóvar logra un filme entrañable , lleno de compasión , comprensión , amor , amistad , esperanza y humanidad que es sencillamente inolvidable . '
NEGATIVE:0 a few hours after you've seen it , you forget you've been to the movies . 
POSITIVE:1 director andrew niccol . . . demonstrates a wry understanding of the quirks of fame . his healthy sense of satire is light and fun . . . .

POSITIVE:1 has an unmistakable , easy joie de vivre . 
POSITIVE:1 yes , it's as good as you remember . in fact , even better . 
NEGATIVE:0 even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
POSITIVE:1 happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude . for proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet . 
NEGATIVE:0 a minor-league soccer remake of the longest yard . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film can depress you about life itself . 
POSITIVE:1 a cutesy romantic tale with a twist .

POSITIVE:1 the acting , costumes , music , cinematography and sound are all astounding given the production's austere locales .

POSITIVE:1 visually fascinating . . . an often intense character study about fathers and sons , loyalty and duty . 
NEGATIVE:0 barely gets off the ground . 
NEGATIVE:0 what you get with empire is a movie you've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a latino in the lead . 
POSITIVE:1 the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul . . . he elevates the experience to a more mythic level . 
NEGATIVE:0 [t]he script isn't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate bela lugosi's now-cliched vampire accent . 
NEGATIVE:0 newcomer helmer kevin donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept – a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman . 
NEGATIVE:0 sweet home alabama is one dumb movie , but its stupidity is so relentlessly harmless that it almost wins you over in the end .

NEGATIVE:0 no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .

POSITIVE:1 if there's no art here , it's still a good yarn -- which is nothing to sneeze at these days . 
NEGATIVE:0 a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
NEGATIVE:0 one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact . 
NEGATIVE:0 an awkward and indigestible movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr . besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms . shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . 
NEGATIVE:0 simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this is satire , it's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook . 
POSITIVE:1 based on a devilishly witty script by heather mcgowan and niels mueller , the film gets great laughs , but never at the expense of its characters
NEGATIVE:0 despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
POSITIVE:1 an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best . 
POSITIVE:1 if " lilo & stitch " isn't the most edgy piece of disney animation to hit the silver screen , then this first film to use a watercolor background since " dumbo " certainly ranks as the most original in years . 
NEGATIVE:0 the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense . 
NEGATIVE:0 soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .

POSITIVE:1 an intense and effective film about loneliness and the chilly anonymity of the environments where so many of us spend so much of our time . 
NEGATIVE:0 this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .

POSITIVE:1 this is a sincerely crafted picture that deserves to emerge from the traffic jam of holiday movies . 
POSITIVE:1 another best of the year selection . 
POSITIVE:1 angel presents events partly from the perspective of aurelie and christelle , and infuses the film with the sensibility of a particularly nightmarish fairytale . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra . 
NEGATIVE:0 only about as sexy and dangerous as an actress in a role that reminds at every turn of elizabeth berkley's flopping dolphin-gasm . 
POSITIVE:1 'aunque recurre a ciertos clichés del género , la poderosa actuación de robin williams perdona las fallas del guión . '
POSITIVE:1 it may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that cannot be denied . 
POSITIVE:1 works because we're never sure if ohlinger's on the level or merely a dying , delusional man trying to get into the history books before he croaks . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .

NEGATIVE:0 i've had more interesting -- and , dare i say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .

POSITIVE:1 an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naiveté and sophistication . 
NEGATIVE:0 a zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking morlocks . 
NEGATIVE:0 while much of the cast has charm -- especially allodi and nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me . 
POSITIVE:1 a real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .

POSITIVE:1 several degrees shy of the gross-out contests one expects from current teen fare . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic disney adaptation of j . m . barrie's peter pan . 
NEGATIVE:0 depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it's being . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of this is very original , and it isn't particularly funny . 
POSITIVE:1 now as a former gong show addict , i'll admit it , my only complaint is that we didn't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show . 
POSITIVE:1 at its best when the guarded , resentful betty and the manipulative yet needy margot are front and center . 
NEGATIVE:0 verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills . 
POSITIVE:1 while puerile men dominate the story , the women shine . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . unspeakably , unbearably dull , featuring reams of flatly delivered dialogue and a heroine who comes across as both shallow and dim-witted . 
POSITIVE:1 it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
NEGATIVE:0 replacing john carpenter's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld blair witch video-cam footage . of all the halloween's , this is the most visually unappealing . 
POSITIVE:1 it's bright , pristine style and bold colors make it as much fun as reading an oversized picture book before bedtime . 
POSITIVE:1 not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral--and , hence , more chillingly effective . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a good movie in spurts , but when it doesn't work , it's at important times . 
POSITIVE:1 this is one of the outstanding thrillers of recent years . 
NEGATIVE:0 madonna still can't act a lick . 
POSITIVE:1 an unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture . 
POSITIVE:1 smart , provocative and blisteringly funny . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work . 
POSITIVE:1 a carefully structured scream of consciousness that is tortured and unsettling--but unquestionably alive . 
POSITIVE:1 300 years of russian history and culture compressed into an evanescent , seamless and sumptuous stream of consciousness . 
POSITIVE:1 an ebullient tunisian film about the startling transformation of a tradition-bound widow who is drawn into the exotic world of belly dancing . 
POSITIVE:1 the large-format film is well suited to capture these musicians in full regalia and the incredible imax sound system lets you feel the beat down to your toes . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the worst movies of the year . . . . watching it was painful . 
NEGATIVE:0 what started out as a taut contest of wills between bacon and theron , deteriorates into a protracted and borderline silly chase sequence . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
POSITIVE:1 quiet , adult and just about more stately than any contemporary movie this year . . . a true study , a film with a questioning heart and mind that isn't afraid to admit it doesn't have all the answers . 
POSITIVE:1 some movies blend together as they become distant memories . mention " solaris " five years from now and i'm sure those who saw it will have an opinion to share . 
POSITIVE:1 stevenson's performance is at once clueless and fiercely committed , a volatile combination . 
NEGATIVE:0 another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
POSITIVE:1 highlights are the terrific performances by christopher plummer , as the prime villain , and nathan lane as vincent crummles , the eccentric theater company manager . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is no " waterboy ! " 
POSITIVE:1 a wild comedy that could only spring from the demented mind of the writer of being john malkovich . 
POSITIVE:1 while this gentle and affecting melodrama will have luvvies in raptures , it's far too slight and introspective to appeal to anything wider than a niche audience . 
POSITIVE:1 the wonder of mostly martha is the performance of gedeck , who makes martha enormously endearing . 
NEGATIVE:0 is " ballistic " worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer . 
NEGATIVE:0 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention
NEGATIVE:0 this is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the cliff-notes over reading a full-length classic . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . 
NEGATIVE:0 another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . 
POSITIVE:1 an action/thriller of the finest kind , evoking memories of day of the jackal , the french connection , and heat . 
POSITIVE:1 as a science fiction movie , " minority report " astounds . 
POSITIVE:1 it is refreshingly undogmatic about its characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . 
POSITIVE:1 a quiet , pure , elliptical film
NEGATIVE:0 it's too long , too repetitive , and takes way too many years to resolve to be a total winner . 
NEGATIVE:0 shreve's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera . 
POSITIVE:1 if you enjoy more thoughtful comedies with interesting conflicted characters ; this one is for you . 
POSITIVE:1 until ( the ) superfluous . . . epilogue that leaks suspension of disbelief like a sieve , die another day is as stimulating & heart-rate-raising as any james bond thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 none of his actors stand out , but that's less of a problem here than it would be in another film : characterization matters less than atmosphere . 
NEGATIVE:0 ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action . 
POSITIVE:1 douglas mcgrath's nicholas nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically . 
NEGATIVE:0 a shame that stealing harvard is too busy getting in its own way to be anything but frustrating , boring , and forgettable . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
POSITIVE:1 after making several adaptations of other writers' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject . 
NEGATIVE:0 an occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a well-observed and disturbing little movie
NEGATIVE:0 unofficially , national lampoon's van wilder is son of animal house . officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny . 
POSITIVE:1 may take its sweet time to get wherever it's going , but if you have the patience for it , you won't feel like it's wasted yours . 
POSITIVE:1 much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes . 
NEGATIVE:0 any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes . 
NEGATIVE:0 filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water . 
NEGATIVE:0 too bad kramer couldn't make a guest appearance to liven things up . 
POSITIVE:1 'easily my choice for one of the year's best films . '
NEGATIVE:0 a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
POSITIVE:1 the french are rather good at this kind of thing , unlike the americans , who have a passion for musketeers , only to spoof them . 
NEGATIVE:0 as it stands it's an opera movie for the buffs . 
POSITIVE:1 finally , the french-produced " read my lips " is a movie that understands characters must come first . 
POSITIVE:1 romantic comedy and dogme 95 filmmaking may seem odd bedfellows , but they turn out to be delightfully compatible here . 
POSITIVE:1 the son's room is a triumph of gentility that earns its moments of pathos . 
POSITIVE:1 it was filled with shootings , beatings , and more cussing than you could shake a stick at . 
POSITIVE:1 cineasts will revel in those visual in-jokes , as in the film's verbal pokes at everything from the likes of miramax chief harvey weinstein's bluff personal style to the stylistic rigors of denmark's dogma movement . 
POSITIVE:1 this insightful , oscar-nominated documentary , in which children on both sides of the ever-escalating conflict have their say away from watchful parental eyes , gives peace yet another chance . 
NEGATIVE:0 a grating , emaciated flick . 
POSITIVE:1 what a concept , what an idea , what a thrill ride . this is a more fascinating look at the future than " bladerunner " and one of the most high-concept sci fi adventures attempted for the screen . 
POSITIVE:1 devotees of star trek ii : the wrath of khan will feel a nagging sense of deja vu , and the grandeur of the best next generation episodes is lacking . 
POSITIVE:1 brutally honest and told with humor and poignancy , which makes its message resonate . 
POSITIVE:1 if you can keep your eyes open amid all the blood and gore , you'll see del toro has brought unexpected gravity to blade ii . 
POSITIVE:1 gives you the steady pulse of life in a beautiful city viewed through the eyes of a character who , in spite of tragic loss and increasing decrepitude , knows in his bones that he is one of the luckiest men alive . 
NEGATIVE:0 the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction . 
NEGATIVE:0 an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously . 
NEGATIVE:0 given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
POSITIVE:1 a photographic marvel of sorts , and it's certainly an invaluable record of that special fishy community . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not life-affirming — its vulgar and mean , but i liked it . 
NEGATIVE:0 any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors . 
POSITIVE:1 travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment . 
POSITIVE:1 a warm , funny , engaging film . 
NEGATIVE:0 beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
NEGATIVE:0 bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that . 
POSITIVE:1 using an endearing cast , writer/director dover kosashvili takes a slightly dark look at relationships , both sexual and kindred . 
NEGATIVE:0 the misery of these people becomes just another voyeuristic spectacle , to be consumed and forgotten . 
NEGATIVE:0 stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . 
POSITIVE:1 harmless fun . 
POSITIVE:1 not about scares but a mood in which an ominous , pervasive , and unknown threat lurks just below the proceedings and adds an almost constant mindset of suspense . 
NEGATIVE:0 ararat feels like a book report
POSITIVE:1 grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte . 
POSITIVE:1  " home movie " is a sweet treasure and something well worth your time . 
POSITIVE:1 an infectious cultural fable with a tasty balance of family drama and frenetic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . even if you've never heard of chaplin , you'll still be glued to the screen . 
POSITIVE:1 [drumline] is entertaining for what it does , and admirable for what it doesn't do . 
POSITIVE:1 a venturesome , beautifully realized psychological mood piece that reveals its first-time feature director's understanding of the expressive power of the camera . 
NEGATIVE:0 director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie just for friday fans , critics be damned . if you already like this sort of thing , this is that sort of thing all over again . 
POSITIVE:1 a live-wire film that never loses its ability to shock and amaze . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that will touch the hearts of both children and adults , as well as bring audiences to the edge of their seats . 
POSITIVE:1 sayles is making a statement about the inability of dreams and aspirations to carry forward into the next generation . 
POSITIVE:1 because the genre is well established , what makes the movie fresh is smart writing , skewed characters , and the title performance by kieran culkin . 
POSITIVE:1 top-notch action powers this romantic drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher . 
NEGATIVE:0 even with harris's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe lear's soul-stripping breakdown . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to be original , even though it rips off many of its ideas . 
POSITIVE:1 it's definitely a step in the right direction . 
NEGATIVE:0 busy urban comedy is clearly not zhang's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy . 
NEGATIVE:0 statham employs an accent that i think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass american but sometimes just lapses into unhidden british . 
POSITIVE:1 laugh-out-loud lines , adorably ditsy but heartfelt performances , and sparkling , bittersweet dialogue that cuts to the chase of the modern girl's dilemma . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a bland murder-on-campus yawner . 
NEGATIVE:0 this story of unrequited love doesn't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour . 
NEGATIVE:0 the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . 
NEGATIVE:0 what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick . 
POSITIVE:1 a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely cannot last . 
POSITIVE:1 one of those rare films that come by once in a while with flawless amounts of acting , direction , story and pace . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 we could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product . 
POSITIVE:1 high crimes knows the mistakes that bad movies make and is determined not to make them , and maybe that is nobility of a sort . 
POSITIVE:1 [lawrence bounces] all over the stage , dancing , running , sweating , mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place . 
NEGATIVE:0 van wilder doesn't bring anything new to the proverbial table , but it does possess a coherence absent in recent crass-a-thons like tomcats , freddy got fingered , and slackers . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
POSITIVE:1 like its bizarre heroine , it irrigates our souls . 
POSITIVE:1 [an] absorbing documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has its moments of swaggering camaraderie , but more often just feels generic , derivative and done to death . 
POSITIVE:1 whether our action-and-popcorn obsessed culture will embrace this engaging and literate psychodrama isn't much of a mystery , unfortunately . 
POSITIVE:1 writer/director alexander payne ( election ) and his co-writer jim taylor brilliantly employ their quirky and fearless ability to look american angst in the eye and end up laughing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
POSITIVE:1 a low-key labor of love that strikes a very resonant chord . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite the premise of a good story . . . it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too . 
POSITIVE:1 seeing seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy , even though the reality is anything but . 
POSITIVE:1 [ferrera] has the charisma of a young woman who knows how to hold the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 this isn't a movie ; it's a symptom . 
POSITIVE:1 the warnings to resist temptation in this film . . . are blunt and challenging and offer no easy rewards for staying clean . 
NEGATIVE:0 fear dot com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds . 
NEGATIVE:0 a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 what's really so appealing about the characters is their resemblance to everyday children . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasant ramble through the sort of idoosyncratic terrain that errol morris has often dealt with . . . it does possess a loose , lackadaisical charm . 
POSITIVE:1 a well-rounded tribute to a man whose achievements -- and complexities -- reached far beyond the end zone . 
NEGATIVE:0 the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
NEGATIVE:0 [macdowell] ventures beyond her abilities several times here and reveals how bad an actress she is . 
NEGATIVE:0 i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . 
POSITIVE:1 it's something of the ultimate scorsese film , with all the stomach-turning violence , colorful new york gang lore and other hallmarks of his personal cinema painted on their largest-ever historical canvas . 
NEGATIVE:0 plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . 
POSITIVE:1 a summer entertainment adults can see without feeling embarrassed , but it could have been more . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoughtful , reverent portrait of what is essentially a subculture , with its own rules regarding love and family , governance and hierarchy . 
POSITIVE:1 this movie may not have the highest production values you've ever seen , but it's the work of an artist , one whose view of america , history and the awkwardness of human life is generous and deep . 
POSITIVE:1 wow , so who knew charles dickens could be so light-hearted ? 
POSITIVE:1 a taut , intelligent psychological drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly american abroad , and the too-frosty exterior ms . paltrow employs to authenticate her british persona is another liability . 
POSITIVE:1 as well-acted and well-intentioned as all or nothing is , however , the film comes perilously close to being too bleak , too pessimistic and too unflinching for its own good . 
POSITIVE:1 a truly wonderful tale combined with stunning animation . 
NEGATIVE:0 sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate jim carrey who doesn't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb . 
POSITIVE:1 the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting . 
NEGATIVE:0 while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
NEGATIVE:0 not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . 
POSITIVE:1 [director peter] jackson and his crew have so steeped themselves in the majesty of tolkien's writing that every frame produces new joys , whether you're a fan of the books or not . 
NEGATIVE:0 without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
NEGATIVE:0 nearly every attempt at humor here is doa . 
POSITIVE:1 what enlivens this film , beyond the astute direction of cardoso and beautifully detailed performances by all of the actors , is a note of defiance over social dictates . 
NEGATIVE:0 how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless and ugly . 
NEGATIVE:0 whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
POSITIVE:1 it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is an ungainly movie , ill-fitting , with its elbows sticking out where the knees should be . 
NEGATIVE:0 deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
NEGATIVE:0 takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
POSITIVE:1 the story gives ample opportunity for large-scale action and suspense , which director shekhar kapur supplies with tremendous skill . 
NEGATIVE:0 the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
NEGATIVE:0 the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling story of musical passion against governmental odds . 
NEGATIVE:0 if the tuxedo actually were a suit , it would fit chan like a $99 bargain-basement special . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
NEGATIVE:0 a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
NEGATIVE:0 isn't it a bit early in his career for director barry sonnenfeld to do a homage to himself ? and it's a lousy one at that . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot's clearly mythic structure may owe more to disney's strong sense of formula than to the original story . but while the highly predictable narrative falls short , treasure planet is truly gorgeous to behold . 
NEGATIVE:0 slick piece of cross-promotion . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating documentary about the long and eventful spiritual journey of the guru who helped launch the new age . 
NEGATIVE:0 the modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones . 
POSITIVE:1 never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man . the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
NEGATIVE:0 femme fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience . are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of clue ? 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . 
NEGATIVE:0 the concept behind kung pow : enter the fist is hilarious . it's too bad nothing else is . 
POSITIVE:1 a film of delicate interpersonal dances . caine makes us watch as his character awakens to the notion that to be human is eventually to have to choose . it's a sight to behold . 
NEGATIVE:0 much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie . 
POSITIVE:1 an entertaining mix of period drama and flat-out farce that should please history fans . 
NEGATIVE:0 if high crimes were any more generic it would have a universal product code instead of a title . 
NEGATIVE:0 an occasionally interesting but mostly repetitive look at a slice of counterculture that might be best forgotten . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
POSITIVE:1 although laced with humor and a few fanciful touches , the film is a refreshingly serious look at young women . 
POSITIVE:1 the best of the pierce brosnan james bond films to date . 
NEGATIVE:0 totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
POSITIVE:1 i was impressed by how many tit-for-tat retaliatory responses the filmmakers allow before pulling the plug on the conspirators and averting an american-russian armageddon . 
NEGATIVE:0 too much power , not enough puff . 
NEGATIVE:0 below is well below expectations . 
POSITIVE:1 contando com uma premissa curiosa , o filme mergulha o espectador em um clima de forte suspense , culminando em um desfecho que certamente fica na memória . 
POSITIVE:1 effective but too-tepid biopic
NEGATIVE:0  . . . generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's few ideas are stretched to the point of evaporation ; the whole central section is one big chase that seems to have no goal and no urgency . it's just filler . 
POSITIVE:1 the unique niche of self-critical , behind-the-scenes navel-gazing kaufman has carved from orleans' story and his own infinite insecurity is a work of outstanding originality . 
NEGATIVE:0 sheridan seems terrified of the book's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 shiner can certainly go the distance , but isn't world championship material
POSITIVE:1 kosminsky . . . puts enough salt into the wounds of the tortured and self-conscious material to make it sting . 
POSITIVE:1 [westbrook] makes a wonderful subject for the camera . 
POSITIVE:1 khouri manages , with terrific flair , to keep the extremes of screwball farce and blood-curdling family intensity on one continuum . 
NEGATIVE:0 on its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of monsters , inc . , without the latter's imagination , visual charm or texture . 
NEGATIVE:0 as an entertainment destination for the general public , kung pow sets a new benchmark for lameness . 
NEGATIVE:0 although there are several truly jolting scares , there's also an abundance of hackneyed dialogue and more silly satanic business than you can shake a severed limb at . 
POSITIVE:1 what begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
NEGATIVE:0 the question hanging over the time machine is not , as the main character suggests , 'what if ? ' but rather , 'how can you charge money for this ? '
POSITIVE:1 light years/ several warp speeds/ levels and levels of dilithium crystals better than the pitiful insurrection . which isn't to say that it's the equal of some of its predecessors . 
POSITIVE:1 a soap-opera quality twist in the last 20 minutes . . . almost puts the kibosh on what is otherwise a sumptuous work of b-movie imagination . 
POSITIVE:1 jackson and co have brought back the value and respect for the term epic cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 as earnest as a community-college advertisement , american chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . perhaps the heaviest , most joyless movie ever made about giant dragons taking over the world . 
POSITIVE:1 many a parent and their teen ( or preteen ) kid could bond while watching a walk to remember . so could young romantics out on a date . 
POSITIVE:1 mel gibson fights the good fight in vietnam in director randall wallace's flag-waving war flick with a core of decency . 
NEGATIVE:0 at the one-hour mark , herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion . 
POSITIVE:1 last orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters , allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced . it's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective . 
POSITIVE:1 obligada para impotentes , daneses , camareras italianas , profesores de idiomas , y todo aquel que desee una lengua para expresar su amor . 
NEGATIVE:0 were dylan thomas alive to witness first-time director ethan hawke's strained chelsea walls , he might have been tempted to change his landmark poem to , 'do not go gentle into that good theatre . '
NEGATIVE:0 i can't recommend it . but it's surprisingly harmless . 
POSITIVE:1 this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics . 
NEGATIVE:0 that frenetic spectacle [on the tv show] has usually been leavened by a charm that's conspicuously missing from the girls' big-screen blowout . 
POSITIVE:1 with so many bad romances out there , this is the kind of movie that deserves a chance to shine . 
NEGATIVE:0 for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed , mostly inarticulate , hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one . 
POSITIVE:1 it all plays out . . . like a high-end john hughes comedy , a kind of elder bueller's time out . 
NEGATIVE:0 eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
POSITIVE:1 while undisputed isn't exactly a high , it is a gripping , tidy little movie that takes mr . hill higher than he's been in a while . 
POSITIVE:1 a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble . there isn't a weak or careless performance amongst them . 
POSITIVE:1 this is not chabrol's best , but even his lesser works outshine the best some directors can offer . 
POSITIVE:1 cq's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors . 
NEGATIVE:0 zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
POSITIVE:1 for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 skip work to see it at the first opportunity . 
NEGATIVE:0 whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around . 
NEGATIVE:0 the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
POSITIVE:1 psychologically savvy . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it's brilliant . 
NEGATIVE:0 though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most horrific movie experience i've had since " can't stop the music . " it may as well be called " jar-jar binks : the movie . " it's that painful . 
POSITIVE:1 as shaky as the plot is , kaufman's script is still memorable for some great one-liners . 
POSITIVE:1 a very funny movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 it desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time . 
NEGATIVE:0 scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped . 
NEGATIVE:0 the jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious . 
NEGATIVE:0 movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing to fear about " fear dot com " is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
POSITIVE:1 the setting is so cool that it chills the characters , reducing our emotional stake in the outcome of " intacto's " dangerous and seductively stylish game . 
POSITIVE:1 mr . deeds is , as comedy goes , very silly -- and in the best way . 
POSITIVE:1 ok arthouse . the power of this script , and the performances that come with it , is that the whole damned thing didn't get our moral hackles up . 
NEGATIVE:0 even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
NEGATIVE:0 not one moment in the enterprise didn't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . only bond can save us from the latest eccentric , super-wealthy megalomaniac bent on world domination and destruction . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult for a longtime admirer of his work to not be swept up in invincible and overlook its drawbacks . 
NEGATIVE:0 a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is a blunt indictment , part of a perhaps surreal campaign to bring kissinger to trial for crimes against humanity . 
NEGATIVE:0 although it tries to be much more , it's really just another major league . 
POSITIVE:1 a sexy , surprising romance . . . idemoto and kim make a gorgeous pair . . . their scenes brim with sexual possibility and emotional danger . 
NEGATIVE:0 cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude . it makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy's idea of a good time . 
NEGATIVE:0 it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
NEGATIVE:0 this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
NEGATIVE:0 it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . 
NEGATIVE:0 this 90-minute dud could pass for mike tyson's e ! true hollywood story . 
POSITIVE:1 the strong subject matter continues to shock throughout the film . not everyone will play the dark , challenging tune taught by the piano teacher . 
NEGATIVE:0 the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . with the gifted pearce on hand to keep things on semi-stable ground dramatically , this retooled machine is ultimately effective enough at achieving the modest , crowd-pleasing goals it sets for itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bit too eager to please . 
POSITIVE:1 a wry , affectionate delight . 
POSITIVE:1 a colorful , vibrant introduction to a universal human impulse , lushly photographed and beautifully recorded . 
NEGATIVE:0 has little on its mind aside from scoring points with drag gags . 
POSITIVE:1  " extreme ops " exceeds expectations . good fun , good action , good acting , good dialogue , good pace , good cinematography .

POSITIVE:1 add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 
POSITIVE:1 parker cannot sustain the buoyant energy level of the film's city beginnings into its country conclusion
POSITIVE:1 an unflinching look at the world's dispossessed . 
POSITIVE:1 gaunt , silver-haired and leonine , [harris] brings a tragic dimension and savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging sandeman . 
POSITIVE:1 if you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera , this oscar-nominated documentary takes you there . 
NEGATIVE:0 blessed with a searing lead performance by ryan gosling ( murder by numbers ) , the movie is powerful and provocative . it's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness . 
NEGATIVE:0 all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . 
NEGATIVE:0 schneidermeister . . . makin' a fool of himself . . . losin' his fan base . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
POSITIVE:1 it confirms fincher's status as a film maker who artfully bends technical know-how to the service of psychological insight . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its title , punch-drunk love is never heavy-handed . the jabs it employs are short , carefully placed and dead-center . 
NEGATIVE:0 lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie in which laughter and self-exploitation merge into jolly soft-porn 'empowerment . '
NEGATIVE:0 manages to show life in all of its banality when the intention is quite the opposite . 
POSITIVE:1 the animated sequences are well done and perfectly constructed to convey a sense of childhood imagination and creating adventure out of angst . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's just rather leaden and dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
NEGATIVE:0 visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
POSITIVE:1 frida isn't that much different from many a hollywood romance . what sets it apart is the vision that taymor , the avant garde director of broadway's the lion king and the film titus , brings . 
POSITIVE:1 the beauty of the piece is that it counts heart as important as humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . 
POSITIVE:1 both a beautifully made nature film and a tribute to a woman whose passion for this region and its inhabitants still shines in her quiet blue eyes . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is saved from unbearable lightness by the simplicity of the storytelling and the authenticity of the performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? 
NEGATIVE:0 a lifetime movie about men . 
POSITIVE:1 it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg's film is that it truly is romance
NEGATIVE:0 i was perplexed to watch it unfold with an astonishing lack of passion or uniqueness . 
POSITIVE:1 what might have been a predictably heartwarming tale is suffused with complexity . 
POSITIVE:1 as a director , paxton is surprisingly brilliant , deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip . 
POSITIVE:1 my big fat greek wedding is that rare animal known as 'a perfect family film , ' because it's about family . 
NEGATIVE:0 go for la salle's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script . 
POSITIVE:1 an ambitious 'what if ? ' that works . 
POSITIVE:1 goofy , nutty , consistently funny . and educational ! 
POSITIVE:1 the film's appeal has a lot to do with the casting of juliette binoche as sand , who brings to the role her pale , dark beauty and characteristic warmth . 
POSITIVE:1 moving and vibrant . 
POSITIVE:1 windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live . 
POSITIVE:1 often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
NEGATIVE:0 plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
NEGATIVE:0 historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material . 
POSITIVE:1 there is truth here
POSITIVE:1 the solid filmmaking and convincing characters makes this a high water mark for this genre . 
POSITIVE:1 the film runs on a little longer than it needs to -- muccino either doesn't notice when his story ends or just can't tear himself away from the characters -- but it's smooth and professional . 
NEGATIVE:0 an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're the kind of parent who enjoys intentionally introducing your kids to films which will cause loads of irreparable damage that years and years of costly analysis could never fix , i have just one word for you -– decasia
POSITIVE:1 it's not just a feel-good movie , it's a feel movie . you feel good , you feel sad , you feel pissed off , but in the end , you feel alive - which is what they did . 
POSITIVE:1 it is amusing , and that's all it needs to be . 
POSITIVE:1 looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton's exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon . 
NEGATIVE:0 marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 odd and weird . 
POSITIVE:1 working from a surprisingly sensitive script co-written by gianni romoli . . . ozpetek avoids most of the pitfalls you'd expect in such a potentially sudsy set-up . 
NEGATIVE:0 the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
NEGATIVE:0 though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
NEGATIVE:0 full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
POSITIVE:1 cube's charisma and chemistry compensate for corniness and cliche . 
POSITIVE:1 dogtown and z-boys more than exposes the roots of the skateboarding boom that would become " the punk kids' revolution . " 
POSITIVE:1 payne constructs a hilarious ode to middle america and middle age with this unlikely odyssey , featuring a pathetic , endearing hero who is all too human . 
POSITIVE:1 pretty darn good , despite its smarty-pants aura . 
POSITIVE:1 will certainly appeal to asian cult cinema fans and asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about . 
NEGATIVE:0 the intent is almost exactly the same [as the full monty] . all that's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . 
NEGATIVE:0 [newton]wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality . 
NEGATIVE:0 whether jason x is this bad on purpose is never clear . but one thing's for sure : it never comes close to being either funny or scary . 
NEGATIVE:0 dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
POSITIVE:1 highly recommended viewing for its courage , ideas , technical proficiency and great acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
NEGATIVE:0 as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting . 
POSITIVE:1 it's hard to imagine alan arkin being better than he is in this performance . 
NEGATIVE:0 its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer . 
NEGATIVE:0 no such thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses . 
NEGATIVE:0 lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose . 
NEGATIVE:0 undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
POSITIVE:1 a meatier deeper beginning and/or ending would have easily tipped this film into the " a " range , as is , it's a very very strong " b+ . " i love the robust middle of this picture . 
POSITIVE:1 a deliciously nonsensical comedy about a city coming apart at its seams . 
POSITIVE:1 dolgin and franco fashion a fascinating portrait of a vietnamese-born youngster who eagerly and easily assimilated as an all-american girl with a brand new name in southern tennessee . 
NEGATIVE:0 i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . 
POSITIVE:1 a flawed film but an admirable one that tries to immerse us in a world of artistic abandon and political madness and very nearly succeeds . 
POSITIVE:1 the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze . 
POSITIVE:1 a sharp , amusing study of the cult of celebrity . 
NEGATIVE:0 formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not a classic spy-action or buddy movie , but it's entertaining enough and worth a look . 
POSITIVE:1 high crimes steals so freely from other movies and combines enough disparate types of films that it can't help but engage an audience . 
POSITIVE:1 a coming-of-age movie that hollywood wouldn't have the guts to make . 
NEGATIVE:0 although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film . 
NEGATIVE:0 makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . 
POSITIVE:1 often shocking but ultimately worthwhile exploration of motherhood and desperate mothers . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them . 
NEGATIVE:0 this insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering . instead , it'll only put you to sleep . 
POSITIVE:1 a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994's surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility . 
NEGATIVE:0 an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's as if a bored cage spent the duration of the film's shooting schedule waiting to scream : " got aids yet ? " 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms isn't it . 
POSITIVE:1 even when he's not at his most critically insightful , godard can still be smarter than any 50 other filmmakers still at work . 
NEGATIVE:0 if hill isn't quite his generation's don siegel ( or robert aldrich ) , it's because there's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it's all bluster and cliché . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what i was expecting . 
POSITIVE:1 medem may have disrobed most of the cast , leaving their bodies exposed , but the plot remains as guarded as a virgin with a chastity belt . that's why sex and lucia is so alluring . 
POSITIVE:1 it's full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early '80s . 
POSITIVE:1 as they used to say in the 1950s sci-fi movies , signs is a tribute to shyamalan's gifts , which are such that we'll keep watching the skies for his next project . 
NEGATIVE:0 from the opening scenes , it's clear that all about the benjamins is a totally formulaic movie . 
POSITIVE:1 the new insomnia is a surprisingly faithful remake of its chilly predecessor , and when it does elect to head off in its own direction , it employs changes that fit it well rather than ones that were imposed for the sake of commercial sensibilities . 
NEGATIVE:0 sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution . 
NEGATIVE:0 comedy troupe broken lizard's first movie is very funny but too concerned with giving us a plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . 
POSITIVE:1 the dangerous lives of altar boys' take on adolescence feels painfully true . 
POSITIVE:1 while mcfarlane's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films . . . it's also so jarring that it's hard to get back into the boys' story . 
NEGATIVE:0 laggard drama wending its way to an uninspired philosophical epiphany . 
POSITIVE:1 somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 a cruelly funny twist on teen comedy packed with inventive cinematic tricks and an ironically killer soundtrack
NEGATIVE:0 the chocolate factory without charlie . 
NEGATIVE:0 bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . 
NEGATIVE:0 though its atmosphere is intriguing . . . the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression . 
POSITIVE:1 if the man from elysian fields is doomed by its smallness , it is also elevated by it--the kind of movie that you enjoy more because you're one of the lucky few who sought it out . 
POSITIVE:1 what's most memorable about circuit is that it's shot on digital video , whose tiny camera enables shafer to navigate spaces both large . . . and small . . . with considerable aplomb . 
POSITIVE:1 remarkable for its intelligence and intensity . 
POSITIVE:1 shot in rich , shadowy black-and-white , devils chronicles , with increasingly amused irony , the relationship between reluctant captors and befuddled captives . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 sheridan had a wonderful account to work from , but , curiously , he waters it down , turning grit and vulnerability into light reading . 
NEGATIVE:0 long time dead ? not nearly long enough . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés . 
NEGATIVE:0 k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich . 
POSITIVE:1 all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can't begin to tell you how tedious , how resolutely unamusing , how thoroughly unrewarding all of this is , and what a reckless squandering of four fine acting talents . . . 
POSITIVE:1 despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience . 
NEGATIVE:0 sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 really is a pan-american movie , with moments of genuine insight into the urban heart . 
POSITIVE:1 tim allen is great in his role but never hogs the scenes from his fellow cast , as there are plenty of laughs and good lines for everyone in this comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 the appearance of treebeard and gollum's expanded role will either have you loving what you're seeing , or rolling your eyes . i loved it ! gollum's 'performance' is incredible ! 
NEGATIVE:0 the iditarod lasts for days - this just felt like it did . 
POSITIVE:1 cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
NEGATIVE:0 his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive . 
POSITIVE:1 an intriguing look at the french film industry during the german occupation ; its most delightful moments come when various characters express their quirky inner selves . 
NEGATIVE:0 the actors pull out all the stops in nearly every scene , but to diminishing effect . the characters never change . 
POSITIVE:1 it's like an old warner bros . costumer jived with sex -- this could be the movie errol flynn always wanted to make , though bette davis , cast as joan , would have killed him . 
NEGATIVE:0 exactly what it claims to be -- a simple diversion for the kids . 
NEGATIVE:0 vaguely interesting , but it's just too too much . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . del toro maintains a dark mood that makes the film seem like something to endure instead of enjoy . 
POSITIVE:1 in between all the emotional seesawing , it's hard to figure the depth of these two literary figures , and even the times in which they lived . but they fascinate in their recklessness . 
NEGATIVE:0 a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
NEGATIVE:0 offers absolutely nothing i hadn't already seen . 
POSITIVE:1 a gorgeous , high-spirited musical from india that exquisitely blends music , dance , song , and high drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 nonsensical , dull " cyber-horror " flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 this misty-eyed southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand . 
POSITIVE:1 pacino and williams seem to keep upping the ante on each other , just as their characters do in the film . what results is the best performance from either in years . 
POSITIVE:1 tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star . 
POSITIVE:1 though the film's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare . 
NEGATIVE:0 too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century . 
POSITIVE:1 oh , james ! your 20th outing shows off a lot of stamina and vitality , and get this , madonna's cameo doesn't suck ! 
NEGATIVE:0 crikey indeed . 
POSITIVE:1 what lifts the film high above run-of-the-filth gangster flicks is its refusal to recognise any of the signposts , as if discovering a way through to the bitter end without a map . 
POSITIVE:1 very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan
POSITIVE:1 a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people . 
NEGATIVE:0 this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
POSITIVE:1 the best comedy concert movie i've seen since cho's previous concert comedy film , i'm the one that i want , in 2000 . 
POSITIVE:1 at times funny and at other times candidly revealing , it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . an agreeable time-wasting device -- but george pal's low-tech 1960 version still rules the epochs . 
POSITIVE:1 far from heaven is a dazzling conceptual feat , but more than that , it's a work of enthralling drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the whole thing succeeded only in making me groggy . 
NEGATIVE:0 mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
NEGATIVE:0 i found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays . 
POSITIVE:1 fresh and raw like a blown-out vein , narc takes a walking-dead , cop-flick subgenre and beats new life into it . 
NEGATIVE:0 gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
POSITIVE:1 this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family
POSITIVE:1 if this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you can't wait to see what happens next . 
NEGATIVE:0 is anyone else out there getting tired of the whole slo-mo , double-pistoled , ballistic-pyrotechnic hong kong action aesthetic ? 
POSITIVE:1 evokes the 19th century with a subtlety that is an object lesson in period filmmaking . 
POSITIVE:1 whatever complaints i might have , i'd take [its] earnest errors and hard-won rewards over the bombastic self-glorification of other feel-good fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor's club any time . 
POSITIVE:1 speaks eloquently about the symbiotic relationship between art and life . 
NEGATIVE:0 the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . 
POSITIVE:1 yes , mibii is rote work and predictable , but with a philosophical visual coming right at the end that extravagantly redeems it . 
POSITIVE:1 the most consistently funny of the austin powers films . 
NEGATIVE:0 a boring , pretentious muddle that uses a sensational , real-life 19th-century crime as a metaphor for -- well , i'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop . 
NEGATIVE:0 if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
NEGATIVE:0 a prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp . 
NEGATIVE:0 has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd . 
POSITIVE:1 while the story does seem pretty unbelievable at times , it's awfully entertaining to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable . 
NEGATIVE:0 while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . unbearably lame . 
NEGATIVE:0 though moonlight mile is replete with acclaimed actors and actresses and tackles a subject that's potentially moving , the movie is too predictable and too self-conscious to reach a level of high drama . 
POSITIVE:1 at once disarmingly straightforward and strikingly devious . 
NEGATIVE:0 seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it's a sad , sick sight . 
POSITIVE:1 it's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits . if only it had the story to match . 
POSITIVE:1 watching haneke's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment . but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting . 
NEGATIVE:0 has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
NEGATIVE:0 it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track . 
POSITIVE:1 baran isn't the most transporting or gripping film from iran -- or , indeed , by its director -- but it's a worthy companion to the many fine , focused films emerging from that most surprising of nations . 
POSITIVE:1 a new film from bill plympton , the animation master , is always welcome . 
POSITIVE:1 decasia is what has happened already to so many silent movies , newsreels and the like . the unexpected thing is that its dying , in this shower of black-and-white psychedelia , is quite beautiful . 
NEGATIVE:0 has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . 
POSITIVE:1 the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides . . . [and] personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy . 
NEGATIVE:0 trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens . 
POSITIVE:1 what's most striking about this largely celebratory film . . . is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world . 
NEGATIVE:0 [e]ventually , every idea in this film is flushed down the latrine of heroism . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie has a script ( by paul pender ) made of wood , and it's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions . 
POSITIVE:1 passable entertainment , but it's the kind of motion picture that won't make much of a splash when it's released , and will not be remembered long afterwards . 
NEGATIVE:0 gets better after foster leaves that little room . 
NEGATIVE:0 nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera . 
NEGATIVE:0 even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a can of 2-day old coke . you can taste it , but there's no fizz . 
POSITIVE:1 its sheer dynamism is infectious . 
POSITIVE:1 it will not appeal to the impatient , but those who like long books and movies will admire the way it accumulates power and depth . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . 
NEGATIVE:0 basically a static series of semi-improvised ( and semi-coherent ) raps between the stars . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you're an agnostic carnivore , you can enjoy much of jonah simply , and gratefully , as laugh-out-loud lunacy with a pronounced monty pythonesque flavor . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . 
NEGATIVE:0 feeble comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 not even the hanson brothers can save it
NEGATIVE:0 it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
NEGATIVE:0 a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 bright seems alternately amused and disgusted with this material , and he can't help throwing in a few of his own touches . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
NEGATIVE:0 a suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre's most enabling victim . . . and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers . 
NEGATIVE:0 contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . 
NEGATIVE:0 so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sequel plays out like a flimsy excuse to give blade fans another look at wesley snipes' iconic hero doing battle with dozens of bad guys -- at once . 
POSITIVE:1 it is nature against progress . in fessenden's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale . 
NEGATIVE:0 empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
POSITIVE:1 a taut , sobering film . 
POSITIVE:1 'estupendamente actuada , sumamente emotiva y profundamente humana , es una experiencia fílmica imposible de olvidar'
NEGATIVE:0 sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many barney videos . 
NEGATIVE:0 halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles . it's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have ( and probably should have ) been a lighthearted comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is darkly funny in its observation of just how much more grueling and time-consuming the illusion of work is than actual work . 
NEGATIVE:0 no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously didn't invest much into itself either . 
POSITIVE:1 makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 after sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work . 
NEGATIVE:0 jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . 
NEGATIVE:0 too intensely focused on the travails of being hal hartley to function as pastiche , no such thing is hartley's least accessible screed yet . 
NEGATIVE:0 you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this . 
POSITIVE:1 this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it's told by the people who were there . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're looking for a smart , nuanced look at de sade and what might have happened at picpus , sade is your film .

NEGATIVE:0 a tv episode inflated past its natural length . 
NEGATIVE:0 the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes . 
NEGATIVE:0 showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant " if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny " syndrome . 
POSITIVE:1 [fessenden] is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
NEGATIVE:0 when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . 
POSITIVE:1 i won't argue with anyone who calls 'slackers' dumb , insulting , or childish . . . but i laughed so much that i didn't mind . 
POSITIVE:1 boomers and their kids will have a barrie good time . 
POSITIVE:1 weighty and ponderous but every bit as filling as the treat of the title .

POSITIVE:1 the next generation of mob movie . part low rent godfather . part three stooges . 
POSITIVE:1 like the best of godard's movies . . . it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable . 
NEGATIVE:0 essentially " fatal attraction " remade for viewers who were in diapers when the original was released in 1987 . . . . this story gets sillier , not scarier , as it goes along . . . 
POSITIVE:1 driven by a fantastic dual performance from ian holm . . . the film is funny , insightfully human and a delightful lark for history buffs . 
NEGATIVE:0 what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
NEGATIVE:0 it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
NEGATIVE:0 nasty , ugly , pointless and depressing , even if you hate clowns . 
NEGATIVE:0 it virtually defines a comedy that's strongly mediocre , with funny bits surfacing every once in a while . 
POSITIVE:1 impossible as it may sound , this film's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition . 
NEGATIVE:0 [i]f you've been to more than one indie flick in your life , chances are you've already seen this kind of thing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
NEGATIVE:0 a beautifully shot but dull and ankle-deep 'epic . '
POSITIVE:1 o fantasma is boldly , confidently orchestrated , aesthetically and sexually , and its impact is deeply and rightly disturbing . 
NEGATIVE:0 such a fine idea for a film , and such a stultifying , lifeless execution . 
POSITIVE:1 amy and matthew have a bit of a phony relationship , but the film works in spite of it . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about . 
NEGATIVE:0 serving sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it . 
NEGATIVE:0 [javier bardem is] one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director gerardo vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama . 
NEGATIVE:0 never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
POSITIVE:1 the premise of jason x is silly but strangely believable . 
NEGATIVE:0 ill-considered , unholy hokum . 
POSITIVE:1 this odd , poetic road movie , spiked by jolts of pop music , pretty much takes place in morton's ever-watchful gaze -- and it's a tribute to the actress , and to her inventive director , that the journey is such a mesmerizing one . 
NEGATIVE:0 ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film . 
NEGATIVE:0 another rent installment for the ian fleming estate . 
NEGATIVE:0 a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
NEGATIVE:0 once she lets her love depraved leads meet , [denis'] story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
POSITIVE:1 otto-sallies has a real filmmaker's eye . 
NEGATIVE:0 full of witless jokes , dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios , and saddled with a general air of misogyny
POSITIVE:1 there is a beautiful , aching sadness to it all . paul cox needed to show it . it is up to you to decide if you need to see it . 
POSITIVE:1 a fantastically vital movie that manages to invest real humor , sensuality , and sympathy into a story about two adolescent boys . 
POSITIVE:1 at once a testament to the divine calling of education and a demonstration of the painstaking process of imparting knowledge . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a fine , focused piece of work that reopens an interesting controversy and never succumbs to sensationalism . 
POSITIVE:1 for those of an indulgent , slightly sunbaked and summery mind , sex and lucia may well prove diverting enough . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a polished and relatively sincere piece of escapism . 
NEGATIVE:0 since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . 
POSITIVE:1 it takes this never-ending confusion and hatred , puts a human face on it , evokes shame among all who are party to it and even promotes understanding . 
NEGATIVE:0 to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
NEGATIVE:0 imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
POSITIVE:1 it finds its moviegoing pleasures in the tiny events that could make a person who has lived her life half-asleep suddenly wake up and take notice . 
POSITIVE:1 this sensitive , smart , savvy , compelling coming-of-age drama delves into the passive-aggressive psychology of co-dependence and the struggle for self-esteem . 
POSITIVE:1 lan yu is a genuine love story , full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery . 
POSITIVE:1 intelligent and moving . 
POSITIVE:1  " the best disney movie since the lion king " 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low . 
POSITIVE:1 you should pay nine bucks for this : because you can hear about suffering afghan refugees on the news and still be unaffected . dramas like this make it human . 
NEGATIVE:0 an affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer's previous collaboration , miss congeniality . 
POSITIVE:1 chilling but uncommercial look into the mind of jeffrey dahmer , serial killer . 
POSITIVE:1 a rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics . 
NEGATIVE:0 the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . 
NEGATIVE:0 a listless and desultory affair . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . 
POSITIVE:1 crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action . 
POSITIVE:1 an intimate , good-humored ethnic comedy like numerous others but cuts deeper than expected . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are plenty of scenes in frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself . 
NEGATIVE:0 the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm guessing the director is a magician . after all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it doesn't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde's wit and the actors' performances . 
POSITIVE:1 lovely and amazing is holofcener's deep , uncompromising curtsy to women she knows , and very likely is . when all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , i trust , will you . 
NEGATIVE:0 a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level . 
POSITIVE:1 the fascination comes in the power of the huston performance , which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile , and in the way the ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react . 
NEGATIVE:0 it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the best of a growing strain of daring films . . . that argue that any sexual relationship that doesn't hurt anyone and works for its participants is a relationship that is worthy of our respect . 
POSITIVE:1 while cherish doesn't completely survive its tonal transformation from dark comedy to suspense thriller , it's got just enough charm and appealing character quirks to forgive that still serious problem . 
NEGATIVE:0 succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
POSITIVE:1 the kind of movie that comes along only occasionally , one so unconventional , gutsy and perfectly executed it takes your breath away .

NEGATIVE:0 possession is in the end an honorable , interesting failure . it falls far short of poetry , but it's not bad prose . 
POSITIVE:1 seldahl's barbara is a precise and moving portrait of someone whose world is turned upside down , first by passion and then by illness . 
NEGATIVE:0 if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . " 
POSITIVE:1 campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful . 
POSITIVE:1 seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized , quasi-shakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil . 
POSITIVE:1 it is a film that will have people walking out halfway through , will encourage others to stand up and applaud , and will , undoubtedly , leave both camps engaged in a ferocious debate for years to come . 
NEGATIVE:0 we never feel anything for these characters , and as a result the film is basically just a curiosity . 
POSITIVE:1 a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
POSITIVE:1 a droll , bitchy frolic which pokes fun at the price of popularity and small-town pretension in the lone star state . 
NEGATIVE:0 cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge . 
NEGATIVE:0 pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0 davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that doesn't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine . 
NEGATIVE:0 make no mistake , ivans xtc . is a mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
NEGATIVE:0 as it stands , there's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more . 
NEGATIVE:0 kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world . 
POSITIVE:1 inherently caustic and oddly whimsical , the film chimes in on the grieving process and strangely draws the audience into the unexplainable pain and eccentricities that are attached to the concept of loss . 
NEGATIVE:0 several uninteresting , unlikeable people do bad things to and with each other in " unfaithful . " why anyone who is not a character in this movie should care is beyond me . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is very difficult to care about the character , and that is the central flaw of the film . 
POSITIVE:1 not a film for the faint of heart or conservative of spirit , but for the rest of us -- especially san francisco lovers -- it's a spirited film and a must-see . 
NEGATIVE:0 meandering and glacially paced , and often just plain dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 …its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place . 
POSITIVE:1 if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of " the isle " you'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women . 
NEGATIVE:0 you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . 
POSITIVE:1 stripped almost entirely of such tools as nudity , profanity and violence , labute does manage to make a few points about modern man and his problematic quest for human connection . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bad movie that happened to good actors . 
POSITIVE:1 while it would be easy to give crush the new title of two weddings and a funeral , it's a far more thoughtful film than any slice of hugh grant whimsy . 
NEGATIVE:0 diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
POSITIVE:1 this submarine drama earns the right to be favorably compared to das boot . 
POSITIVE:1 it's pretty linear and only makeup-deep , but bogdanovich ties it together with efficiency and an affection for the period . 
NEGATIVE:0 aside from showing us in explicit detail how difficult it is to win over the two-drink-minimum crowd , there's little to be learned from watching 'comedian'
POSITIVE:1  . . . less a story than an inexplicable nightmare , right down to the population's shrugging acceptance to each new horror . 
NEGATIVE:0 i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
POSITIVE:1 part of the charm of satin rouge is that it avoids the obvious with humour and lightness . 
NEGATIVE:0 not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
NEGATIVE:0 its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche . 
POSITIVE:1 a sly female empowerment movie , although not in a way anyone would expect . 
NEGATIVE:0 unwieldy contraption . 
NEGATIVE:0 'how many more voyages can this limping but dearly-loved franchise survive ? '
NEGATIVE:0 cho's fans are sure to be entertained ; it's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i'm not one of them . 
POSITIVE:1 some may choose to interpret the film's end as hopeful or optimistic but i think payne is after something darker . 
POSITIVE:1 an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world . 
POSITIVE:1 filmmakers dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann area headed east , far east , in retelling a historically significant , and personal , episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens of thousands of german jewish refugees while the world's democracie
POSITIVE:1 the performances are an absolute joy . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not particularly well made , but since i found myself howling more than cringing , i'd say the film works . 
POSITIVE:1 a true-blue delight . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
NEGATIVE:0 any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
NEGATIVE:0 a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness . 
POSITIVE:1 while the humor is recognizably plympton , he has actually bothered to construct a real story this time . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a ripper of a yarn and i for one enjoyed the thrill of the chill . naomi watts is terrific as rachel ; her petite frame and vulnerable persona emphasising her plight and isolation . 
NEGATIVE:0 at every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability . . . all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while banderas looks like he's not trying to laugh at how bad it
NEGATIVE:0 frankly , it's kind of insulting , both to men and women . and it's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting . 
NEGATIVE:0 like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . 
NEGATIVE:0 little more than a well-mounted history lesson . 
NEGATIVE:0 the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences . 
NEGATIVE:0 a pretentious mess . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're hard up for raunchy college humor , this is your ticket right here . 
NEGATIVE:0 the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome . 
POSITIVE:1 tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother . 
NEGATIVE:0 the 70-year-old godard has become , to judge from in praise of love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them . 
NEGATIVE:0 koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own . 
NEGATIVE:0 lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . 
POSITIVE:1 the modern remake of dumas's story is long on narrative and ( too ) short on action . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits , headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i've ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work . 
NEGATIVE:0 sweet gentle jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ? 
NEGATIVE:0 [swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
NEGATIVE:0 labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes it worth watching is quaid's performance . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . 
POSITIVE:1 gosling creates a staggeringly compelling character , a young man whose sharp intellect is at the very root of his contradictory , self-hating , self-destructive ways . 
POSITIVE:1 the pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other year-end movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 [jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer . 
POSITIVE:1 at the end of the movie , my 6-year-old nephew said , " i guess i come from a broken family , and my uncles are all aliens , too . " congrats disney on a job well done , i enjoyed it just as much ! 
POSITIVE:1 an eye-boggling blend of psychedelic devices , special effects and backgrounds , 'spy kids 2' is a visual treat for all audiences . 
POSITIVE:1 an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
NEGATIVE:0 madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose . 
POSITIVE:1 makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran's borderlands . 
POSITIVE:1 despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there's no scene that screams " bathroom break ! " 
NEGATIVE:0 there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
POSITIVE:1 forget about one oscar nomination for julianne moore this year - she should get all five . 
POSITIVE:1 [stephen] earnhart's film is more about the optimism of a group of people who are struggling to give themselves a better lot in life than the ones they currently have . 
POSITIVE:1 a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film that suffers because of its many excesses . 
NEGATIVE:0 the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
POSITIVE:1 just as the recent argentine film son of the bride reminded us that a feel-good movie can still show real heart , time of favor presents us with an action movie that actually has a brain . 
NEGATIVE:0 woody , what happened ? 
NEGATIVE:0  " what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it , " one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . 
NEGATIVE:0 kapur's contradictory feelings about his material result in a movie that works against itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 'abandon all hope , ye who enter here' . . . you should definitely let dante's gloomy words be your guide . 
POSITIVE:1 the production has been made with an enormous amount of affection , so we believe these characters love each other . 
POSITIVE:1 heaven is a haunting dramatization of a couple's moral ascension . 
NEGATIVE:0 director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle . 
POSITIVE:1 although it bangs a very cliched drum at times , this crowd-pleaser's fresh dialogue , energetic music , and good-natured spunk are often infectious . 
POSITIVE:1 the results , if not memorable , are at least interesting . 
POSITIVE:1 robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side . 
NEGATIVE:0 what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this . 
NEGATIVE:0 typical animé , with cheapo animation ( like saturday morning tv in the '60s ) , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and japanese names . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart , sassy and exceptionally charming romantic comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 should have gone straight to video . it looks like an action movie , but it's so poorly made , on all levels , that it doesn't even qualify as a spoof of such . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's just plain boring . 
POSITIVE:1 occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new . 
POSITIVE:1 though nijinsky's words grow increasingly disturbed , the film maintains a beguiling serenity and poise that make it accessible for a non-narrative feature . 
POSITIVE:1 goldmember is funny enough to justify the embarrassment of bringing a barf bag to the moviehouse . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting ( and funnier ) than his . 
POSITIVE:1 nothing denis has made before , like beau travil and nenette et boni , could prepare us for this gory , perverted , sex-soaked riff on the cannibal genre . 
POSITIVE:1 the rock is destined to be the 21st century's new " conan " and that he's going to make a splash even greater than arnold schwarzenegger , jean-claud van damme or steven segal . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy . 
POSITIVE:1 while parker and co-writer catherine di napoli are faithful to melville's plotline , they and a fully engaged supporting cast . . . have made the old boy's characters more quick-witted than any english lit major would have thought possible . 
POSITIVE:1 entertaining despite its one-joke premise with the thesis that women from venus and men from mars can indeed get together . 
POSITIVE:1 para hitler , o mundo era sua tela ; e o horror , seu pincel . e max retrata este fato com elegante abandono , numa triste constatação da realidade histórica . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating , unnerving examination of the delusions of one unstable man . 
POSITIVE:1 sits uneasily as a horror picture . . . but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family . 
NEGATIVE:0 even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is ingenious fun . see it . 
NEGATIVE:0 who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze . 
POSITIVE:1 disappointingly , the characters are too strange and dysfunctional , tom included , to ever get under the skin , but this is compensated in large part by the off-the-wall dialogue , visual playfulness and the outlandishness of the idea itself . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a very funny , heartwarming film . it has fun with the quirks of family life , but it also treats the subject with fondness and respect . 
NEGATIVE:0 it could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director clare peploe's misunderstanding of marivaux's rhythms , and mira sorvino's limitations as a classical actress . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
POSITIVE:1 the film proves unrelentingly grim -- and equally engrossing . 
POSITIVE:1 using his audience as a figurative port-of-call , dong pulls his even-handed ideological ship to their dock for unloading , before he continues his longer journey still ahead . 
NEGATIVE:0 follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie is maddening . it conveys a simple message in a visual style that is willfully overwrought . 
POSITIVE:1 claude miller airs out a tight plot with an easy pace and a focus on character drama over crime-film complications . 
POSITIVE:1 its direction , its script , and weaver's performance as a vaguely discontented woman of substance make for a mildly entertaining 77 minutes , if that's what you're in the mood for . 
POSITIVE:1 as played by ryan gosling , danny is a frighteningly fascinating contradiction . 
POSITIVE:1 the second chapter of the harry potter series is even more magical than the first and simply the best family film of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 happily stays close to the ground in a spare and simple manner and doesn't pummel us with phony imagery or music . 
POSITIVE:1 nervy and sensitive , it taps into genuine artistic befuddlement , and at the same time presents a scathing indictment of what drives hollywood . 
NEGATIVE:0 slap her - she's not funny ! no french people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half . 
POSITIVE:1 a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . 
POSITIVE:1 a small movie with a big heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else . 
NEGATIVE:0 they threw loads of money at an idea that should've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans . 
POSITIVE:1 [washington's] strong hand , keen eye , sweet spirit and good taste are reflected in almost every scene . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing . 
NEGATIVE:0 how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
POSITIVE:1 'what's the russian word for wow ! ? '
NEGATIVE:0 a waterlogged version of 'fatal attraction' for the teeny-bopper set . . . a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a gorgeous film - vivid with color , music and life . delight your senses and crash this wedding ! 
POSITIVE:1 smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise . 
NEGATIVE:0 the latest installment in the pokemon canon , pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where pokemon graze in peace . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
POSITIVE:1 likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes . 
NEGATIVE:0 christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good . 
NEGATIVE:0 kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
POSITIVE:1 what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment . still , i'm not quite sure what the point is…
POSITIVE:1 the visuals alone make metropolis worth seeing . 
POSITIVE:1 boasts enough funny dialogue and sharp characterizations to be mildly amusing . 
NEGATIVE:0 it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff . 
NEGATIVE:0 no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . 
NEGATIVE:0 kenneth branagh's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly british playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in los angeles . 
POSITIVE:1 i couldn't recommend this film more . 
NEGATIVE:0 the narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking mystery science theater 3000 guys . 
POSITIVE:1 like these russo guys lookin' for their mamet instead found their sturges . 
POSITIVE:1 the universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in 'baran . '
POSITIVE:1 real women have curves doesn't offer any easy answers . 
NEGATIVE:0 children , christian or otherwise , deserve to hear the full story of jonah's despair -- in all its agonizing , catch-22 glory -- even if they spend years trying to comprehend it . 
POSITIVE:1 like all of egoyan's work , ararat is fiercely intelligent and uncommonly ambitious . 
NEGATIVE:0 no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . 
POSITIVE:1 at times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated ( depending upon where you live ) , ignorant fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two . 
POSITIVE:1 all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based . 
POSITIVE:1 'film aficionados cannot help but love cinema paradiso , whether the original version or new director's cut . '
POSITIVE:1 we can see the wheels turning , and we might resent it sometimes , but this is still a nice little picture , made by bright and friendly souls with a lot of good cheer . 
POSITIVE:1 an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all its violence , the movie is remarkably dull with only caine making much of an impression . 
NEGATIVE:0 why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 
POSITIVE:1 some actors have so much charisma that you'd be happy to listen to them reading the phone book . hugh grant and sandra bullock are two such likeable actors . 
NEGATIVE:0 not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best . 
NEGATIVE:0 while [hill] has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . spellbinding fun and deliciously exploitative . 
NEGATIVE:0 as original and insightful as last week's episode of behind the music . 
POSITIVE:1 you may leave the theater with more questions than answers , but darned if your toes won't still be tapping . 
NEGATIVE:0 without non-stop techno or the existential overtones of a kieslowski morality tale , maelström is just another winter sleepers . 
NEGATIVE:0 an annoying orgy of excess and exploitation that has no point and goes nowhere . 
POSITIVE:1 the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer . 
POSITIVE:1 my wife's plotting is nothing special ; it's the delivery that matters here . 
NEGATIVE:0 the big ending surprise almost saves the movie . it's too bad that the rest isn't more compelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script by vincent r . nebrida . . . tries to cram too many ingredients into one small pot . 
NEGATIVE:0 it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . 
NEGATIVE:0 based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . 
NEGATIVE:0 an exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter . 
POSITIVE:1 what redeems the film is the cast , particularly the ya-yas themselves . 
POSITIVE:1 a mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last . 
NEGATIVE:0 a series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story . 
NEGATIVE:0 even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . and that leaves a hole in the center of the salton sea . 
NEGATIVE:0 at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue . 
NEGATIVE:0 the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun – toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout . 
POSITIVE:1 this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done . it's a scorcher . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a strange film , one that was hard for me to warm up to . 
NEGATIVE:0 a hit- and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped . 
POSITIVE:1 even better than the first one ! 
NEGATIVE:0 except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility . 
POSITIVE:1 a brutally honest documentary about a much anticipated family reunion that goes wrong thanks to culture shock and a refusal to empathize with others . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness . 
NEGATIVE:0 got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1/2-hour , dissipated length . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a diverting enough hour-and-a-half for the family audience . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a sour little movie at its core ; an exploration of the emptiness that underlay the relentless gaiety of the 1920's . . . the film's ending has a " what was it all for ? " feeling to it , but like the 1920's , the trip there is a great deal of fun . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's plot may be shallow , but you've never seen the deep like you see it in these harrowing surf shots . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit . 
POSITIVE:1 smith is careful not to make fun of these curious owners of architectural oddities . instead , he shows them the respect they are due . 
POSITIVE:1 leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama . 
POSITIVE:1 like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen's astringent wit . 
POSITIVE:1 waydowntown is by no means a perfect film , but its boasts a huge charm factor and smacks of originality . 
NEGATIVE:0 you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
NEGATIVE:0 [allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply . 
NEGATIVE:0 highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within . 
POSITIVE:1 as warm as it is wise , deftly setting off uproarious humor with an underlying seriousness that sneaks up on the viewer , providing an experience that is richer than anticipated . 
POSITIVE:1 that the film opens with maggots crawling on a dead dog is not an out of place metaphor . 
NEGATIVE:0 an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . 
POSITIVE:1 phillip noyce and all of his actors -- as well as his cinematographer , christopher doyle -- understand the delicate forcefulness of greene's prose , and it's there on the screen in their version of the quiet american . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors . 
POSITIVE:1 the characters are complex and quirky , but entirely believable as the remarkable ensemble cast brings them to life . 
NEGATIVE:0 cruel and inhuman cinematic punishment . . . simultaneously degrades its characters , its stars and its audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book . 
NEGATIVE:0 director david fincher and writer david koepp can't sustain it . 
POSITIVE:1 proves a servicable world war ii drama that can't totally hide its contrivances , but it at least calls attention to a problem hollywood too long has ignored . 
NEGATIVE:0 has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 the modern-day royals have nothing on these guys when it comes to scandals . it's only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after . 
POSITIVE:1 it's amazingly perceptive in its subtle , supportive but unsentimental look at the marks family . 
POSITIVE:1 as underwater ghost stories go , below casts its spooky net out into the atlantic ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the bermuda triangle . 
NEGATIVE:0 any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . 
NEGATIVE:0 chaotic , self-indulgent and remarkably ugly to look at , it's . . . like a series of pretentiously awful student films strung together into one feature-length horror . 
NEGATIVE:0 animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
POSITIVE:1 coy but exhilarating , with really solid performances by ving rhames and wesley snipes . 
POSITIVE:1 as commander-in-chief of this film , bigelow demonstrates a breadth of vision and an attention to detail that propels her into the upper echelons of the directing world . 
POSITIVE:1 blithely anachronistic and slyly achronological . 
POSITIVE:1 the ensemble cast turns in a collectively stellar performance , and the writing is tight and truthful , full of funny situations and honest observations . 
POSITIVE:1 grant is certainly amusing , but the very hollowness of the character he plays keeps him at arms length
POSITIVE:1 this isn't a retooled genre piece , the tale of a guy and his gun , but an amiably idiosyncratic work . 
NEGATIVE:0 this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
NEGATIVE:0 for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets [sci-fi] rehash . 
POSITIVE:1 certainly the performances are worthwhile . 
NEGATIVE:0 ah-nuld's action hero days might be over . 
POSITIVE:1 majidi's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times .

NEGATIVE:0 mediocre fable from burkina faso . 
NEGATIVE:0 you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to . 
POSITIVE:1 the most brilliant and brutal uk crime film since jack carter went back to newcastle , the first half of gangster no . 1 drips with style and , at times , blood . 
NEGATIVE:0 whether quitting will prove absorbing to american audiences is debatable . 
POSITIVE:1 with an admirably dark first script by brent hanley , paxton , making his directorial feature debut , does strong , measured work . 
POSITIVE:1 'divertida , enternecedora , universal y profundamente sincera , es una de las mejores comedias románticas en mucho tiempo . una verdadera delicia . '
POSITIVE:1 it thankfully goes easy on the reel/real world dichotomy that [jaglom] pursued with such enervating determination in venice/venice . 
NEGATIVE:0 britney's performance cannot be faulted . lucy's a dull girl , that's all . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . 
POSITIVE:1 those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give " scratch " a second look . 
POSITIVE:1 most impressive , though , is the film's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters' emotional wounds . 
POSITIVE:1 it may not be a huge cut of above the rest , but i enjoyed barbershop . it's a funny little movie with clever dialogue and likeable characters . 
POSITIVE:1 the film exudes the urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have bitterly forsaken . 
POSITIVE:1 by no means a great movie , but it is a refreshingly forthright one . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is nothing but familiar territory . 
NEGATIVE:0 under 15 ? a giggle a minute . over age 15 ? big fat waste of time . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes the film special is the refreshingly unhibited enthusiasm that the people , in spite of clearly evident poverty and hardship , bring to their music . 
POSITIVE:1 a bonanza of wacky sight gags , outlandish color schemes , and corny visual puns that can be appreciated equally as an abstract frank tashlin comedy and as a playful recapitulation of the artist's career . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 
NEGATIVE:0 an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
POSITIVE:1 features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film . 
POSITIVE:1 it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives . 
NEGATIVE:0 twenty years later , reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task . 
POSITIVE:1 colorful and deceptively buoyant until it suddenly pulls the rug out from under you , burkinabe filmmaker dani kouyate's reworking of a folk story whose roots go back to 7th-century oral traditions is also a pointed political allegory . 
POSITIVE:1 this flick is about as cool and crowd-pleasing as a documentary can get . 
POSITIVE:1 a film in a class with spike lee's masterful do the right thing . 
POSITIVE:1 a painfully funny ode to bad behavior . 
NEGATIVE:0 [u]nrelentingly stupid . 
NEGATIVE:0 now here's a sadistic bike flick that would have made vittorio de sica proud . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] crushing disappointment . 
POSITIVE:1 though the plot is predictable , the movie never feels formulaic , because the attention is on the nuances of the emotional development of the delicate characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 oozes condescension from every pore . 
NEGATIVE:0 not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
NEGATIVE:0 like life on the island , the movie grows boring despite the scenery . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately , in the history of the academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about " chicago " in 2002 . zellweger's whiny pouty-lipped poof faced and spindly attempt at playing an ingenue makes her nomination as best actress even more of a an a
POSITIVE:1 'enigma' is the kind of engaging historical drama that hollywood appears to have given up on in favor of sentimental war movies in the vein of 'we were soldiers . '
POSITIVE:1  . . . an interesting slice of history . 
POSITIVE:1 ub equally spoofs and celebrates the more outre aspects of 'black culture' and the dorkier aspects of 'white culture , ' even as it points out how inseparable the two are . 
NEGATIVE:0 its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is flat . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence . 
POSITIVE:1 a haunting tale of murder and mayhem .

POSITIVE:1 merci pour le movie . 
POSITIVE:1 more romantic , more emotional and ultimately more satisfying than the teary-eyed original . 
POSITIVE:1 the first bond movie in ages that isn't fake fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . 
NEGATIVE:0 just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills . 
NEGATIVE:0  . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . 
NEGATIVE:0 although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result doesn't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke . 
POSITIVE:1 these characters are so well established that the gang feels comfortable with taking insane liberties and doing the goofiest stuff out of left field , and i'm all for that . 
POSITIVE:1 don't judge this one too soon - it's a dark , gritty story but it takes off in totally unexpected directions and keeps on going . 
POSITIVE:1 this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those so-so films that could have been much better . 
POSITIVE:1 secretary manages a neat trick , bundling the flowers of perversity , comedy and romance into a strangely tempting bouquet of a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 this bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . 
POSITIVE:1 a witty , low-key romantic comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 the people in jessica are so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we're never sure how things will work out . 
NEGATIVE:0 as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
POSITIVE:1 a vivid , spicy footnote to history , and a movie that grips and holds you in rapt attention from start to finish . 
POSITIVE:1 by surrounding us with hyper-artificiality , haynes makes us see familiar issues , like racism and homophobia , in a fresh way . 
POSITIVE:1 there's a spontaneity to the chateau , a sense of light-heartedness , that makes it attractive throughout . 
NEGATIVE:0 de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . 
POSITIVE:1 an uncluttered , resonant gem that relays its universal points without lectures or confrontations . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie gets muted and routine . 
NEGATIVE:0  " an entire film about researchers quietly reading dusty old letters . " 
POSITIVE:1 koury frighteningly and honestly exposes one teenager's uncomfortable class resentment and , in turn , his self-inflicted retaliation .

POSITIVE:1 serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying destination . 
POSITIVE:1 a delectable and intriguing thriller filled with surprises , read my lips is an original . this is a story of two misfits who don't stand a chance alone , but together they are magnificent . 
NEGATIVE:0 a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable . 
POSITIVE:1 'they' begins and ends with scenes so terrifying i'm still stunned . and i've decided to leave a light on every night from now on . 
POSITIVE:1 if steven soderbergh's 'solaris' is a failure it is a glorious failure . 
POSITIVE:1 this filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it's filmed tosca that you want . i'll stay with the stage versions , however , which bite cleaner , and deeper . 
NEGATIVE:0 a major waste . . . generic . 
POSITIVE:1 it celebrates the group's playful spark of nonconformity , glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his 'angels of light . '
POSITIVE:1 the film brilliantly shines on all the characters , as the direction is intelligently accomplished . 
POSITIVE:1 by and large this is mr . kilmer's movie , and it's his strongest performance since the doors . 
NEGATIVE:0 if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . 
NEGATIVE:0 after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes the movie special is its utter sincerity . 
POSITIVE:1 if borstal boy isn't especially realistic , it is an engaging nostalgia piece . 
POSITIVE:1 michael moore has perfected the art of highly entertaining , self-aggrandizing , politically motivated documentary-making , and he's got as potent a topic as ever here . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm sure the filmmaker would disagree , but , honestly , i don't see the point . it's a visual rorschach test and i must have failed . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . [a] strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense . 
POSITIVE:1 about schmidt belongs to nicholson . gone are the flamboyant mannerisms that are the trademark of several of his performances . as schmidt , nicholson walks with a slow , deliberate gait , chooses his words carefully and subdues his natural exuberance . 
NEGATIVE:0 i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
NEGATIVE:0 lástima por schwarzenegger , pero es hora de que deje la estafeta a las nuevas generaciones . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie that at its best doesn't just make the most out of its characters' flaws but insists on the virtue of imperfection . 
NEGATIVE:0 glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
POSITIVE:1 all but the most persnickety preteens should enjoy this nonthreatening but thrilling adventure . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoughtful , moving piece that faces difficult issues with honesty and beauty . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's maudlin focus on the young woman's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of hollywood heart-string plucking . 
POSITIVE:1 a film about a young man finding god that is accessible and touching to the marrow . 
NEGATIVE:0 a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off . 
NEGATIVE:0 the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite hoffman's best efforts , wilson remains a silent , lumpish cipher ; his encounters reveal nothing about who he is or who he was before . 
POSITIVE:1 the result is somewhat satisfying -- it still comes from spielberg , who has never made anything that wasn't at least watchable . but it's also disappointing to a certain degree . 
POSITIVE:1 the performers are so spot on , it is hard to conceive anyone else in their roles . 
NEGATIVE:0 the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 <em>ash wednesday</em> is not edward burns' best film , but it is a good and ambitious film . and it marks him as one of the most interesting writer/directors working today . 
POSITIVE:1 it's truly awful and heartbreaking subject matter , but one whose lessons are well worth revisiting as many times as possible . 
POSITIVE:1 gooding is the energetic frontman , and it's hard to resist his enthusiasm , even if the filmmakers come up with nothing original in the way of slapstick sequences . 
NEGATIVE:0 this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . 
POSITIVE:1 sleek and arty . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mechanical action-comedy whose seeming purpose is to market the charismatic jackie chan to even younger audiences . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a weak , manipulative , pencil-thin story that is miraculously able to entertain anyway . 
POSITIVE:1 'interesante y disfrutable trabajo gracias a que prescinde del clásico elemento estadounidense patriotero y manipulador . '
NEGATIVE:0 aan opportunity wasted . 
NEGATIVE:0 chen films the resolutely downbeat smokers only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book . 
NEGATIVE:0 bears about as much resemblance to the experiences of most battered women as spider-man does to the experiences of most teenagers . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no way to sort out the mess in our heads and deconstruct where it all went wrong . this is an hour and a half of daydreaming . 
NEGATIVE:0 this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better . 
NEGATIVE:0 [green is] the comedy equivalent of saddam hussein , and i'm just about ready to go to the u . n . and ask permission for a preemptive strike . 
POSITIVE:1 on the heels of the ring comes a similarly morose and humorless horror movie that , although flawed , is to be commended for its straight-ahead approach to creepiness . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the animal planet documentary series , crocodile hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring . 
POSITIVE:1 me no lika da accents so good , but i thoroughly enjoyed the love story . scott baio is turning in some delightful work on indie projects . 
POSITIVE:1 it is a likable story , told with competence . 
NEGATIVE:0 richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , heartbreak hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit . 
NEGATIVE:0 somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
POSITIVE:1 for movie lovers as well as opera lovers , tosca is a real treat . 
NEGATIVE:0 tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll . 
NEGATIVE:0 resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
POSITIVE:1 the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly . 
POSITIVE:1 an uneven but intriguing drama that is part homage and part remake of the italian masterpiece . 
POSITIVE:1 infidelity drama is nicely shot , well-edited and features a standout performance by diane lane . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no denying the elaborateness of the artist's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity . 
NEGATIVE:0 the characters are interesting and the relationship between yosuke and saeko is worth watching as it develops , but there's not enough to the story to fill two hours . 
POSITIVE:1 an edifying glimpse into the wit and revolutionary spirit of these performers and their era . 
POSITIVE:1 a virtual roller-coaster ride of glamour and sleaze . 
POSITIVE:1 chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of 'ethnic cleansing . '

NEGATIVE:0 dilbert without the right-on satiric humor . 
NEGATIVE:0 a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
NEGATIVE:0 makes for some truly odd , at times confusing , kids entertainment . . . but at least this time there's some centered storytelling to go along with all the weird stuff . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
NEGATIVE:0 both overstuffed and undernourished . . . the film can't be called a solid success , although there's plenty of evidence here to indicate clooney might have better luck next time . 
POSITIVE:1 while maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among wiseman's warmest . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm convinced i could keep a family of five blind , crippled , amish people alive in this situation better than these british soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking . 
POSITIVE:1 mr . parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . 
NEGATIVE:0 so verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-tv movie . 
POSITIVE:1 begins like a docu-drama but builds its multi-character story with a flourish . 
NEGATIVE:0 marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various new york city locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .

NEGATIVE:0 the movie feels like it's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens . 
NEGATIVE:0 leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
NEGATIVE:0 a really good premise is frittered away in middle-of-the-road blandness . 
POSITIVE:1 at the film's centre is a precisely layered performance by an actor in his mid-seventies , michel piccoli .

NEGATIVE:0 more trifle than triumph . 
POSITIVE:1 the closest thing to the experience of space travel
POSITIVE:1 graham greene's novel of colonialism and empire is elevated by michael caine's performance as a weary journalist in a changing world . 
NEGATIVE:0 donovan . . . squanders his main asset , jackie chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences . 
POSITIVE:1 although tender and touching , the movie would have benefited from a little more dramatic tension and some more editing . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . certainly an entertaining ride , despite many talky , slow scenes . but something seems to be missing . a sense of real magic , perhaps . 
NEGATIVE:0 bond-inspired ? certainly . likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ? let's hope not . 
POSITIVE:1 it's no surprise that as a director washington demands and receives excellent performances , from himself and from newcomer derek luke . 
POSITIVE:1 take care is nicely performed by a quintet of actresses , but nonetheless it drags during its 112-minute length . 
POSITIVE:1 steadfastly uncinematic but powerfully dramatic . 
NEGATIVE:0 seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director's experiment is a successful one . 
POSITIVE:1 doug liman , the director of bourne , directs the traffic well , gets a nice wintry look from his locations , absorbs us with the movie's spycraft and uses damon's ability to be focused and sincere . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .

NEGATIVE:0 [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
POSITIVE:1 kaufman creates an eerie sense of not only being there at the time of these events but the very night matthew was killed . 
NEGATIVE:0 one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
POSITIVE:1 you don't know whether to admire the film's stately nature and call it classicism or be exasperated by a noticeable lack of pace . or both . 
NEGATIVE:0 the adventures of pluto nash is a whole lot of nada . 
NEGATIVE:0 this u-boat doesn't have a captain . 
NEGATIVE:0 a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
POSITIVE:1 a delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , mostly martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 an incendiary , deeply thought-provoking look at one of the most peculiar ( and peculiarly venomous ) bigotries in our increasingly frightening theocracy
POSITIVE:1 it's easy to be cynical about documentaries in which underdogs beat the odds and the human spirit triumphs , but westbrook's foundation and dalrymple's film earn their uplift . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the greatest films i've ever seen . 
POSITIVE:1 at its best ( and it does have some very funny sequences ) looking for leonard reminds you just how comically subversive silence can be . 
NEGATIVE:0 the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
POSITIVE:1 a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart .

NEGATIVE:0 a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater . 
POSITIVE:1 enriched by a strong and unforced supporting cast . 
POSITIVE:1 a sun-drenched masterpiece , part parlor game , part psychological case study , part droll social satire . 
POSITIVE:1 it's usually a bad sign when directors abandon their scripts and go where the moment takes them , but olympia , wash . , based filmmakers anne de marcken and marilyn freeman did just that and it's what makes their project so interesting . 
NEGATIVE:0 this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
NEGATIVE:0 all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
NEGATIVE:0 the acting is just fine , but there's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .

POSITIVE:1 niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators' symbolic images with his words , insinuating , for example , that in hollywood , only god speaks to the press
NEGATIVE:0 children of the century , though well dressed and well made , ultimately falls prey to the contradiction that afflicts so many movies about writers .

NEGATIVE:0 equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 
POSITIVE:1 we root for [clara and paul] , even like them , though perhaps it's an emotion closer to pity . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sight of the name bruce willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind--maybe too much . 
NEGATIVE:0 beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
NEGATIVE:0 an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
POSITIVE:1 bennett's dramatization of her personal descent into post-breakup perdition has a morbid appeal that's tough to shake . 
POSITIVE:1 amari has dressed up this little parable in a fairly irresistible package full of privileged moments and memorable performances . 
POSITIVE:1 there has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently . . . but peter mattei's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note . 
NEGATIVE:0 nicolas cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career . 
POSITIVE:1 nettelbeck has crafted an engaging fantasy of flavours and emotions , one part romance novel , one part recipe book . 
NEGATIVE:0 shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 
NEGATIVE:0 works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them . 
POSITIVE:1 84 minutes of rolling musical back beat and supercharged cartoon warfare . it's also , clearly , great fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 a spooky yarn of demonic doings on the high seas that works better the less the brain is engaged . 
POSITIVE:1 there's a vastness implied in metropolis that is just breathtaking . 
POSITIVE:1 the last kiss will probably never achieve the popularity of my big fat greek wedding , but its provocative central wedding sequence has far more impact . 
POSITIVE:1 [shyamalan] continues to cut a swathe through mainstream hollywood , while retaining an integrity and refusing to compromise his vision .

POSITIVE:1 by the end of no such thing the audience , like beatrice , has a watchful affection for the monster .

POSITIVE:1 saved from being merely way-cool by a basic , credible compassion . 
NEGATIVE:0 visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide treasure planet entirely and completely reimagine it .

NEGATIVE:0 like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . 
POSITIVE:1 kids should have a stirring time at this beautifully drawn movie . and adults will at least have a dream image of the west to savor whenever the film's lamer instincts are in the saddle . 
POSITIVE:1 to those who have not read the book , the film is a much better mother-daughter tale than last summer's 'divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood , ' but that's not saying much .

NEGATIVE:0 un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image . 
POSITIVE:1 this film puts wang at the forefront of china's sixth generation of film makers . 
NEGATIVE:0 a wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a mrs . robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .

NEGATIVE:0 there's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .

POSITIVE:1 i have a confession to make : i didn't particularly like e . t . the first time i saw it as a young boy . that is because - damn it ! - i also wanted a little alien as a friend ! 
POSITIVE:1 that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is a tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend .

NEGATIVE:0 the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
POSITIVE:1 may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done . 
NEGATIVE:0 it appears as if even the filmmakers didn't know what kind of movie they were making . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . an inviting piece of film . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence . 
POSITIVE:1 what eric schaeffer has accomplished with never again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary . but it's defiantly and delightfully against the grain . 
POSITIVE:1 i'm sure mainstream audiences will be baffled , but , for those with at least a minimal appreciation of woolf and clarissa dalloway , the hours represents two of those well spent . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a great deal of sizzle and very little steak . but what spectacular sizzle it is ! . . . in this incarnation its fizz is infectious .

NEGATIVE:0 the comedy is nonexistent . 
POSITIVE:1 a realistically terrifying movie that puts another notch in the belt of the long list of renegade-cop tales .

NEGATIVE:0 simplistic , silly and tedious . 
POSITIVE:1 assured , glossy and shot through with brittle desperation . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '
NEGATIVE:0 impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie doesn't quite fly . for starters , the story is just too slim . 
POSITIVE:1 greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . 
POSITIVE:1 a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done . 
POSITIVE:1 twohy knows how to inflate the mundane into the scarifying , and gets full mileage out of the rolling of a stray barrel or the unexpected blast of a phonograph record . 
POSITIVE:1 schnitzler does a fine job contrasting the sleekness of the film's present with the playful paranoia of the film's past . 
NEGATIVE:0 skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
POSITIVE:1 but this is not a movie about an inhuman monster ; it's about a very human one . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based 'drama , ' but the emphasis on the latter leaves blue crush waterlogged . 
NEGATIVE:0 a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
POSITIVE:1 meyjes' provocative film might be called an example of the haphazardness of evil . 
NEGATIVE:0 the somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make green dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other . 
POSITIVE:1 more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are . . . an amusing little catch . 
POSITIVE:1 measured against practically any like-themed film other than its oscar-sweeping franchise predecessor the silence of the lambs , red dragon rates as an exceptional thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 high drama , disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue . 
NEGATIVE:0 so much facile technique , such cute ideas , so little movie . 
POSITIVE:1 with its jerky hand-held camera and documentary feel , bloody sunday is a sobering recount of a very bleak day in derry . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . 
POSITIVE:1 an invaluable historical document thanks to the filmmaker's extraordinary access to massoud , whose charm , cultivation and devotion to his people are readily apparent . 
POSITIVE:1 this is one of those war movies that focuses on human interaction rather than battle and action sequences . . . and it's all the stronger because of it . 
NEGATIVE:0 elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . 
NEGATIVE:0 murphy and wilson actually make a pretty good team . . . but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . 
POSITIVE:1 peppered with witty dialogue and inventive moments . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating . 
POSITIVE:1 everything that has to do with yvan and charlotte , and everything that has to do with yvan's rambunctious , jewish sister and her non-jew husband , feels funny and true . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
POSITIVE:1 a refreshing korean film about five female high school friends who face an uphill battle when they try to take their relationships into deeper waters . 
NEGATIVE:0 a clash between the artificial structure of the story and the more contemporary , naturalistic tone of the film . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point . 
NEGATIVE:0 denzel washington's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony . 
POSITIVE:1  " the mothman prophecies " is a difficult film to shake from your conscience when night falls . 
POSITIVE:1 i prefer soderbergh's concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky's mostly male , mostly patriarchal debating societies . 
POSITIVE:1 don't wait to see this terrific film with your kids -- if you don't have kids borrow some . 
NEGATIVE:0 the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels . 
NEGATIVE:0 the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . 
POSITIVE:1 overall very good for what it's trying to do . 
POSITIVE:1 grainy photography mars an otherwise delightful comedy of errors . 
POSITIVE:1 whether writer-director anne fontaine's film is a ghost story , an account of a nervous breakdown , a trip down memory lane , all three or none of the above , it is as seductive as it is haunting . 
POSITIVE:1 ms . seigner and mr . serrault bring fresh , unforced naturalism to their characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
POSITIVE:1 zany , exuberantly irreverent animated space adventure . 
POSITIVE:1 audrey tatou has a knack for picking roles that magnify her outrageous charm , and in this literate french comedy , she's as morning-glory exuberant as she was in amélie . 
POSITIVE:1 provides an intriguing window into the imagination and hermetic analysis of todd solondz . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not a bad premise , just a bad movie . 
POSITIVE:1 in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work . 
NEGATIVE:0 a rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by epps . 
POSITIVE:1 melds derivative elements into something that is often quite rich and exciting , and always a beauty to behold . 
POSITIVE:1 an exquisitely crafted and acted tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 before it takes a sudden turn and devolves into a bizarre sort of romantic comedy , steven shainberg's adaptation of mary gaitskill's harrowing short story . . . is a brilliantly played , deeply unsettling experience . 
POSITIVE:1 writer/director walter hill is in his hypermasculine element here , once again able to inject some real vitality and even art into a pulpy concept that , in many other hands would be completely forgettable . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you've got a house full of tots -- don't worry , this will be on video long before they grow up and you can wait till then . 
POSITIVE:1 campanella's competent direction and his excellent cast overcome the obstacles of a predictable outcome and a screenplay that glosses over rafael's evolution . 
POSITIVE:1 poetry in motion captured on film . while it can be a bit repetitive , overall it's an entertaining and informative documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 a mix of gritty realism , crisp storytelling and radiant compassion that effortlessly draws you in . 
NEGATIVE:0 the average local news columnist has a bigger rant on the war between modern landscape architecture and small-town america . 
NEGATIVE:0 when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . 
POSITIVE:1 the film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission . . . if " gory mayhem " is your idea of a good time . 
NEGATIVE:0 they're going through the motions , but the zip is gone . 
POSITIVE:1 kinnear doesn't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth . 
POSITIVE:1 offers an interesting look at the rapidly changing face of beijing . 
POSITIVE:1 not since tom cruise in risky business has an actor made such a strong impression in his underwear . 
POSITIVE:1 combines sharp comedy , old-fashioned monster movie atmospherics , and genuine heart to create a film that's not merely about kicking undead * * * , but also about dealing with regret and , ultimately , finding redemption . 
NEGATIVE:0 might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage . 
POSITIVE:1 this horror-comedy doesn't go for the usual obvious laughs at the expense of cheap-looking monsters -- unless you count elvira's hooters . 
NEGATIVE:0 writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability . 
NEGATIVE:0 the exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you'll find in this dreary mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 does anyone much think the central story of brendan behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ? 
POSITIVE:1 for devotees of french cinema , safe conduct is so rich with period minutiae it's like dying and going to celluloid heaven . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not like having a real film of nijinsky , but at least it's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered . 
POSITIVE:1 [ " safe conduct " ] is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage . viva le resistance ! 
NEGATIVE:0 watching junk like this induces a kind of abstract guilt , as if you were paying dues for good books unread , fine music never heard . 
POSITIVE:1 while centered on the life experiences of a particular theatrical family , this marvelous documentary touches -- ever so gracefully -- on the entire history of the yiddish theater , both in america and israel . 
NEGATIVE:0 it was a dark and stormy night . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the drama discloses almost nothing . 
POSITIVE:1 the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its hawaiian setting , the science-fiction trimmings and some moments of rowdy slapstick , the basic plot of " lilo " could have been pulled from a tear-stained vintage shirley temple script . 
POSITIVE:1 merchant effectively translates naipaul's lively mix of characters from the page to screen . 
POSITIVE:1 there is a fabric of complex ideas here , and feelings that profoundly deepen them . 
POSITIVE:1 may be far from the best of the series , but it's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . 
POSITIVE:1 each of these stories has the potential for touched by an angel simplicity and sappiness , but thirteen conversations about one thing , for all its generosity and optimism , never resorts to easy feel-good sentiments . 
POSITIVE:1 muccino seems to be exploring the idea of why human beings long for what they don't have , and how this gets us in trouble . but even while his characters are acting horribly , he is always sympathetic . 
NEGATIVE:0 fluffy and disposible . 
POSITIVE:1 smart and taut . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's an earnest debut full of heartfelt performances , but is ultimately let down by a story that is all too predictable . 
NEGATIVE:0 on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a true delight . 
NEGATIVE:0 crossroads feels like a teenybopper ed wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling yarn , but not quite a ripping one . 
POSITIVE:1 directing with a sure and measured hand , [haneke] steers clear of the sensational and offers instead an unflinching and objective look at a decidedly perverse pathology . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's center will not hold . 
NEGATIVE:0 expect the same-old , lame-old slasher nonsense , just with different scenery . 
POSITIVE:1 for a movie audience , the hours doesn't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love . 
POSITIVE:1 if you can stomach the rough content , it's worth checking out for the performances alone . 
POSITIVE:1 it may . . . work as a jaunt down memory lane for teens and young adults who grew up on televised scooby-doo shows or reruns . 
NEGATIVE:0 human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . 
POSITIVE:1 an elegant work , food of love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing . 
POSITIVE:1 a bowel-curdling , heart-stopping recipe for terror . 
NEGATIVE:0 an eccentric little comic/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia . 
NEGATIVE:0 it smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original . 
POSITIVE:1 succeeds where its recent predecessor miserably fails because it demands that you suffer the dreadfulness of war from both sides . 
POSITIVE:1 deflated ending aside , there's much to recommend the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 we may get the full visceral impact of a ruthless army on the warpath but no sense of the devilish complexity of the balkans conflict . 
NEGATIVE:0 imagine a film that begins as a seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of the shining , the thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
NEGATIVE:0 you come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that's at the center of the story . 
POSITIVE:1  . it's a testament to the film's considerable charm that it succeeds in entertaining , despite playing out like a feature-length sitcom replete with stereotypical familial quandaries . there's a sheer unbridled delight in the way the story unfurls . . . 
POSITIVE:1 a riveting documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt . 
NEGATIVE:0 too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
NEGATIVE:0 a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers . 
POSITIVE:1 what the film lacks in general focus it makes up for in compassion , as corcuera manages to find the seeds of hope in the form of collective action . 
POSITIVE:1 this isn't a stand up and cheer flick ; it's a sit down and ponder affair . and thanks to kline's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable . 
POSITIVE:1 a lighthearted , feel-good film that embraces the time-honored truth that the most powerful thing in life is love . 
POSITIVE:1 puts to rest any thought that the german film industry cannot make a delightful comedy centering on food . 
POSITIVE:1 a disturbing examination of what appears to be the definition of a 'bad' police shooting . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films . 
POSITIVE:1 the evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot is plastered with one hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's desire to be liked sometimes undermines the possibility for an exploration of the thornier aspects of the nature/nurture argument in regards to homosexuality . 
POSITIVE:1 you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling . 
NEGATIVE:0 self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
NEGATIVE:0 looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way . 
POSITIVE:1 chilling in its objective portrait of dreary , lost twenty-first century america . 
POSITIVE:1 the script is smart and dark - hallelujah for small favors . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart and funny , albeit sometimes superficial , cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick . 
POSITIVE:1 it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years . 
NEGATIVE:0 parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
NEGATIVE:0 normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . 
POSITIVE:1 andersson creates a world that's at once surreal and disturbingly familiar ; absurd , yet tremendously sad . 
POSITIVE:1 a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy needn't always make us laugh . tim story's not there yet - but 'barbershop' shows he's on his way . 
POSITIVE:1 its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director's previous popcorn work . 
POSITIVE:1 while the path may be familiar , first-time director denzel washington and a top-notch cast manage to keep things interesting . 
POSITIVE:1 …an eerily suspenseful , deeply absorbing piece that works as a treatise on spirituality as well as a solid sci-fi thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
NEGATIVE:0 puportedly " based on true events , " a convolution of language that suggests it's impossible to claim that it is " based on a true story " with a straight face . 
NEGATIVE:0 how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ? 
POSITIVE:1 you don't need to be a hip-hop fan to appreciate scratch , and that's the mark of a documentary that works . 
NEGATIVE:0 'opening up' the play more has partly closed it down . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an unusual , thoughtful bio-drama with a rich subject and some fantastic moments and scenes . 
NEGATIVE:0 so boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it . 
POSITIVE:1 if there's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid . 
POSITIVE:1 one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved . 
POSITIVE:1 a slick , skillful little horror film . 
NEGATIVE:0 it appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept . 
NEGATIVE:0 the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the chemistry between the women and the droll scene-stealing wit and wolfish pessimism of anna chancellor that makes this " two weddings and a funeral " fun . 
POSITIVE:1 fortunately , elling never gets too cloying thanks to the actors' perfect comic timing and sweet , genuine chemistry . 
POSITIVE:1 the events of the film are just so weird that i honestly never knew what the hell was coming next . 
POSITIVE:1 open-ended and composed of layer upon layer , talk to her is a cinephile's feast , an invitation to countless interpretations . 
NEGATIVE:0 maybe it's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul " full frontal " seems , well , contrived . 
POSITIVE:1 a shimmeringly lovely coming-of-age portrait , shot in artful , watery tones of blue , green and brown . 
POSITIVE:1 the way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of gator-bashing are consistently delightful . 
POSITIVE:1 [there's] quite a bit of heart , as you would expect from the directors of the little mermaid and aladdin . 
POSITIVE:1 the quirky drama touches the heart and the funnybone thanks to the energetic and always surprising performance by rachel griffiths . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract . 
POSITIVE:1 a confluence of kiddie entertainment , sophisticated wit and symbolic graphic design . 
POSITIVE:1 not a bad journey at all . 
NEGATIVE:0 neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored . 
POSITIVE:1 i can't say that i liked homeboy ; it'd be more accurate to say that i found it intriguing , bizarre , dogma-like in spots - and quite truthful , in its way . 
POSITIVE:1 rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material . 
POSITIVE:1 it makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film . 
NEGATIVE:0 not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as wonder bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need hollywood doing to us : it preaches . 
POSITIVE:1 subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius . 
POSITIVE:1 for more than two decades mr . nachtwey has traveled to places in the world devastated by war , famine and poverty and documented the cruelty and suffering he has found with an devastating , eloquent clarity . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a somber film , almost completely unrelieved by any comedy beyond the wistful everyday ironies of the working poor . 
POSITIVE:1 jones . . . does offer a brutal form of charisma . 
POSITIVE:1 although commentary on nachtwey is provided . . . it's the image that really tells the tale . 
POSITIVE:1 simultaneously heart-breaking and very funny , the last kiss is really all about performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 overall , it's a pretty mediocre family film . 
NEGATIVE:0 here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . would be a total loss if not for two supporting performances taking place at the movie's edges . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue . 
POSITIVE:1 post 9/11 the philosophical message of " personal freedom first " might not be as palatable as intended . 
POSITIVE:1 as the dominant christine , sylvie testud is icily brilliant . 
POSITIVE:1 thought-provoking and stylish , if also somewhat hermetic . 
NEGATIVE:0 the result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone . 
POSITIVE:1 it's traditional moviemaking all the way , but it's done with a lot of careful period attention as well as some very welcome wit . 
POSITIVE:1 what could have been a daytime soap opera is actually a compelling look at a young woman's tragic odyssey . 
POSITIVE:1 it is quite a vision . 
NEGATIVE:0 the major problem with windtalkers is that the bulk of the movie centers on the wrong character . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
POSITIVE:1 fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations . 
NEGATIVE:0 certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . 
NEGATIVE:0 holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . 
POSITIVE:1 for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . 
POSITIVE:1 spielberg's first real masterpiece , it deserved all the hearts it won -- and wins still , 20 years later . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
POSITIVE:1 beneath the film's obvious determination to shock at any cost lies considerable skill and determination , backed by sheer nerve . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sinister inspiration that fuelled devito's early work is confused in death to smoochy into something both ugly and mindless . 
POSITIVE:1 director of photography benoit delhomme shot the movie in delicious colors , and the costumes and sets are grand . 
POSITIVE:1 terrific as nadia , a russian mail-order bride who comes to america speaking not a word of english , it's kidman who holds the film together with a supremely kittenish performance that gradually accumulates more layers . 
NEGATIVE:0 the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
NEGATIVE:0 meyjes's movie , like max rothman's future , does not work . 
NEGATIVE:0 elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level . 
POSITIVE:1 [gai] comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form . 
NEGATIVE:0 ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless . 
NEGATIVE:0 such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you can't help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production . 
NEGATIVE:0 as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is amateurish , but it's a minor treat . 
NEGATIVE:0 too daft by half . . . but supremely good natured . 
POSITIVE:1 moore's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that's still very much playing itself out . 
POSITIVE:1 meant to reduce blake's philosophy into a tragic coming-of-age saga punctuated by bursts of animator todd mcfarlane's superhero dystopia . 
POSITIVE:1 chicago is sophisticated , brash , sardonic , completely joyful in its execution . 
POSITIVE:1 a generous , inspiring film that unfolds with grace and humor and gradually becomes a testament to faith . 
POSITIVE:1 director lee has a true cinematic knack , but it's also nice to see a movie with its heart so thoroughly , unabashedly on its sleeve . 
POSITIVE:1 it would be disingenuous to call reno a great film , but you can say that about most of the flicks moving in and out of the multiplex . this is a movie that is what it is : a pleasant distraction , a friday night diversion , an excuse to eat popcorn . 
POSITIVE:1 this sci-fi techno-sex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between highlander and lolita . 
NEGATIVE:0 to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
NEGATIVE:0 wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
POSITIVE:1 a bracing , unblinking work that serves as a painful elegy and sobering cautionary tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 there seems to be no clear path as to where the story's going , or how long it's going to take to get there . 
NEGATIVE:0 a thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions . 
POSITIVE:1 creeps you out in high style , even if nakata did it better . 
NEGATIVE:0 the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
POSITIVE:1 ana's journey is not a stereotypical one of self-discovery , as she's already comfortable enough in her own skin to be proud of her rubenesque physique . . . 
POSITIVE:1 thrilling , provocative and darkly funny , this timely sci-fi mystery works on so many different levels that it not only invites , it demands repeated viewings . 
POSITIVE:1 will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 
NEGATIVE:0 an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
POSITIVE:1 tends to pile too many " serious issues " on its plate at times , yet remains fairly light , always entertaining , and smartly written . 
NEGATIVE:0 you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring . 
NEGATIVE:0 off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
NEGATIVE:0 you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sleep-inducing thriller with a single twist that everyone except the characters in it can see coming a mile away . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling journey . . . and " his best friend remembers " is up there with the finest of specials . 
POSITIVE:1 eerily accurate depiction of depression . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a very valuable film . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 lyne's latest , the erotic thriller unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded . 
NEGATIVE:0 yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . 
POSITIVE:1 aside from minor tinkering , this is the same movie you probably loved in 1994 , except that it looks even better . 
POSITIVE:1 as broad and cartoonish as the screenplay is , there is an accuracy of observation in the work of the director , frank novak , that keeps the film grounded in an undeniable social realism . 
NEGATIVE:0 a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
POSITIVE:1 it's fairly self-aware in its dumbness . 
NEGATIVE:0 they were afraid to show this movie to reviewers before its opening , afraid of the bad reviews they thought they'd earn . they were right . 
POSITIVE:1 [moore's] better at fingering problems than finding solutions . but though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more . 
POSITIVE:1 a strong script , powerful direction and splendid production design allows us to be transported into the life of wladyslaw szpilman , who is not only a pianist , but a good human being . 
NEGATIVE:0 what is captured during the conceptual process doesn't add up to a sufficient explanation of what the final dance work , the selection , became in its final form . 
NEGATIVE:0 too bad writer-director adam rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the golden eagle's carpets . 
POSITIVE:1 i've never seen or heard anything quite like this film , and i recommend it for its originality alone . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a compelling and horrifying story , and the laramie project is worthwhile for reminding us that this sort of thing does , in fact , still happen in america . 
NEGATIVE:0 has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies . . . 
POSITIVE:1 grown-up quibbles are beside the point here . the little girls understand , and mccracken knows that's all that matters . 
POSITIVE:1 'if you are in the mood for an intelligent weepy , it can easily worm its way into your heart . '
NEGATIVE:0 the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
POSITIVE:1 there's not much more to this adaptation of the nick hornby novel than charm -- effortless , pleasurable , featherweight charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 it looks good , but it is essentially empty . 
POSITIVE:1 collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . 
POSITIVE:1 payne has created a beautiful canvas , and nicholson proves once again that he's the best brush in the business . 
POSITIVE:1 the comedy makes social commentary more palatable . 
POSITIVE:1 a zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded elvis fans ( but by no means all ) will have fun with . 
NEGATIVE:0 frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . 
POSITIVE:1 when it's not wallowing in hormonal melodrama , " real women have curves " is a sweet , honest , and enjoyable comedy-drama about a young woman who wants many things in life , but fears she'll become her mother before she gets to fulfill her dreams . 
NEGATIVE:0 [taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb . 
NEGATIVE:0 a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
POSITIVE:1 the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry . 
POSITIVE:1 matches neorealism's impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives . 
POSITIVE:1 allows us to hope that nolan is poised to embark a major career as a commercial yet inventive filmmaker . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are plot holes big enough for shamu the killer whale to swim through . 
POSITIVE:1 it's all about anakin . . . and the lustrous polished visuals rich in color and creativity and , of course , special effect . 
POSITIVE:1 [it's] a clever thriller with enough unexpected twists to keep our interest . 
NEGATIVE:0 a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man's quest to find an old flame . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . overly melodramatic . . . 
POSITIVE:1 the case is a convincing one , and should give anyone with a conscience reason to pause . 
POSITIVE:1 the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it . 
POSITIVE:1 [broomfield] uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue . 
POSITIVE:1 an exhilarating serving of movie fluff . 
NEGATIVE:0 sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
POSITIVE:1 a must see for all sides of the political spectrum
NEGATIVE:0 it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . 
POSITIVE:1 not for the prurient or squeamish , it's a daring if overlong examination of an idolized culture , self-loathing and sexual politics . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most slyly exquisite anti-adult movies ever made . 
POSITIVE:1 escapism in its purest form . 
NEGATIVE:0 cacoyannis is perhaps too effective in creating an atmosphere of dust-caked stagnation and labored gentility . 
POSITIVE:1 it's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice . 
POSITIVE:1 reassuring , retro uplifter . 
POSITIVE:1 instead of hitting the audience over the head with a moral , schrader relies on subtle ironies and visual devices to convey point of view . 
POSITIVE:1 while it's nothing we haven't seen before from murphy , i spy is still fun and enjoyable and so aggressively silly that it's more than a worthwhile effort . 
NEGATIVE:0 an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is saved from aren't-kids-cute sentimentality by a warmth that isn't faked and a stately sense of composition . 
NEGATIVE:0  " analyze that " is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original . 
POSITIVE:1 both an admirable reconstruction of terrible events , and a fitting memorial to the dead of that day , and of the thousands thereafter . 
POSITIVE:1 the film grows on you . and how . 
NEGATIVE:0 scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick . 
NEGATIVE:0 too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
POSITIVE:1 an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street . 
POSITIVE:1 you have enough finely tuned acting to compensate for the movie's failings . 
POSITIVE:1 an unbelievably fun film just a leading man away from perfection . 
POSITIVE:1 the actors are simply too good , and the story too intriguing , for technical flaws to get in the way . 
POSITIVE:1 the whole is quite entertaining , but despite its virtues , there is an unsettled feeling to the film . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . 
NEGATIVE:0 the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion . 
NEGATIVE:0 a thriller without a lot of thrills . 
NEGATIVE:0 [nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
POSITIVE:1 as action-adventure , this space-based homage to robert louis stevenson's treasure island fires on all plasma conduits . 
NEGATIVE:0 you expect more from director michael apted ( enigma ) and screenwriter nicholas kazan ( reversal of fortune ) than this cliche pileup . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unintentionally surreal kid's picture . . . in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a vh1 behind the music episode . 
POSITIVE:1 an earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool . 
NEGATIVE:0 the most remarkable ( and frustrating ) thing about world traveler , which opens today in manhattan , is that its protagonist , after being an object of intense scrutiny for 104 minutes , remains a complete blank . 
POSITIVE:1 en sí mismo el rey león es un espectáculo digno de contemplarse en cine , dvd o en su soberbio montaje teatral ; pero el hacerlo en la pantalla imax es una experiencia colosal . 
POSITIVE:1 i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending . 
NEGATIVE:0 what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . manages to fall closer in quality to silence than to the abysmal hannibal . 
POSITIVE:1 handsome and sophisticated approach to the workplace romantic comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 pascale bailly's rom-com provides amélie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest . 
POSITIVE:1 watching this film , what we feel isn't mainly suspense or excitement . the dominant feeling is something like nostalgia . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's crap on a leash--far too polite to scale the lunatic heights of joe dante's similarly styled gremlins . 
NEGATIVE:0 oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
POSITIVE:1 one of the best silly horror movies of recent memory , with some real shocks in store for unwary viewers . 
NEGATIVE:0 this formulaic chiller will do little to boost stallone's career . 
POSITIVE:1 even when there are lulls , the emotions seem authentic , and the picture is so lovely toward the end . . . you almost don't notice the 129-minute running time . 
POSITIVE:1 the film hinges on its performances , and both leads are up to the task . 
NEGATIVE:0 mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
POSITIVE:1 this is not an easy film . but it could be , by its art and heart , a necessary one . 
POSITIVE:1 is office work really as alienating as 'bartleby' so effectively makes it ? 
POSITIVE:1 it's a much more emotional journey than what shyamalan has given us in his past two movies , and gibson , stepping in for bruce willis , is the perfect actor to take us on the trip . 
NEGATIVE:0 not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs . 
POSITIVE:1 it has a subtle way of getting under your skin and sticking with you long after it's over . 
NEGATIVE:0 a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
NEGATIVE:0 first-time writer-director dylan kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people . 
NEGATIVE:0 the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
POSITIVE:1 'frailty " starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different ( and better ) than most films with this theme . 
NEGATIVE:0 it all looks and plays like a $40 million version of a game you're more likely to enjoy on a computer . 
NEGATIVE:0 sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
NEGATIVE:0 veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
NEGATIVE:0 sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
NEGATIVE:0 meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . 
NEGATIVE:0 pretend like your sat scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . 
POSITIVE:1 a tone poem of transgression . 
POSITIVE:1 ferrara directs the entire film with the kind of detachment that makes any given frame look like a family's custom-made christmas card . 
POSITIVE:1 what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
NEGATIVE:0 i never thought i'd say this , but i'd much rather watch teens poking their genitals into fruit pies ! 
NEGATIVE:0 if jews were catholics , this would be catechism
POSITIVE:1 this isn't a narrative film -- i don't know if it's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i'm sure some will try -- but it's as close as anyone has dared to come . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a glorious spectacle like those d . w . griffith made in the early days of silent film . 
POSITIVE:1 he's the scariest guy you'll see all summer . 
NEGATIVE:0 the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
POSITIVE:1 a mess , but it's a sincere mess . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] real pleasure in its laid-back way . 
POSITIVE:1 denver should not get the first and last look at one of the most triumphant performances of vanessa redgrave's career . it deserves to be seen everywhere . 
POSITIVE:1 further proof that the epicenter of cool , beautiful , thought-provoking foreign cinema is smack-dab in the middle of dubya's axis of evil . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it doesn't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks . 
POSITIVE:1 sum " is jack ryan's " do-over . " give credit to everyone from robinson down to the key grip that this bold move works . especially give credit to affleck . 
POSITIVE:1 as home movie gone haywire , it's pretty enjoyable , but as sexual manifesto , i'd rather listen to old tori amos records . 
POSITIVE:1 its cast full of caffeinated comedy performances more than make up for its logical loopholes , which fly by so fast there's no time to think about them anyway . 
NEGATIVE:0 made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because [solondz's] cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's little to recommend snow dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity . 
POSITIVE:1 the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be . 
NEGATIVE:0 weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 [t]here's only so much anyone can do with a florid , overplotted , anne rice rock 'n' roll vampire novel before the built-in silliness of the whole affair defeats them . 
POSITIVE:1 there's . . . an underlying old world sexism to monday morning that undercuts its charm . 
POSITIVE:1 the 1960s rebellion was misdirected : you can't fight your culture . 
NEGATIVE:0 by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . 
POSITIVE:1 as green-guts monster movies go , it's a beaut . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a testament to de niro and director michael caton-jones that by movie's end , we accept the characters and the film , flaws and all . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you are curious to see the darker side of what's going on with young tv actors ( dawson leery did what ? ! ? ) , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there's nothing very attractive about this movie . 
POSITIVE:1 this enthralling documentary . . . is at once playful and haunting , an in-depth portrait of an iconoclastic artist who was fundamentally unknowable even to his closest friends . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving and solidly entertaining comedy/drama that should bolster director and co-writer juan josé campanella's reputation in the united states . 
NEGATIVE:0 bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
POSITIVE:1 so unique and stubborn and charismatic that you want it to be better and more successful than it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action . 
NEGATIVE:0 not even steven spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 what it lacks in substance it makes up for in heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 just one bad idea after another . 
NEGATIVE:0 and people make fun of me for liking showgirls</> . 
POSITIVE:1 pray has really done his subject justice . 
POSITIVE:1 it's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
POSITIVE:1 a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films
POSITIVE:1 a remarkable movie with an unsatisfying ending , which is just the point . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you're a crocodile hunter fan , you'll enjoy at least the " real " portions of the film . if you're looking for a story , don't bother . 
POSITIVE:1 if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters , he doesn't hold them in contempt . 
POSITIVE:1 williams creates a stunning , taxi driver-esque portrayal of a man teetering on the edge of sanity . 
POSITIVE:1 in addition to scoring high for originality of plot -- putting together familiar themes of family , forgiveness and love in a new way -- lilo & stitch has a number of other assets to commend it to movie audiences both innocent and jaded . 
NEGATIVE:0 a profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility . 
POSITIVE:1 monte cristo smartly emphasizes the well-wrought story and omits needless chase scenes and swordfights as the revenge unfolds . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
NEGATIVE:0 anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity . 
POSITIVE:1 the directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge
POSITIVE:1 a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place . 
POSITIVE:1 apart from its own considerable achievement , metropolis confirms tezuka's status as both the primary visual influence on the animé tradition and its defining philosophical conscience . 
NEGATIVE:0 less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . 
POSITIVE:1 a rich tale of our times , very well told with an appropriate minimum of means . 
POSITIVE:1 a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two
POSITIVE:1 twenty years after its first release , e . t . remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg's misunderstood career . 
POSITIVE:1 smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way . 
NEGATIVE:0 zaidan's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured . 
POSITIVE:1 it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen . 
POSITIVE:1 having had the good sense to cast actors who are , generally speaking , adored by the movie-going public , khouri then gets terrific performances from them all . 
NEGATIVE:0 the rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey . 
POSITIVE:1 it's about issues most adults have to face in marriage and i think that's what i liked about it -- the real issues tucked between the silly and crude storyline . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
POSITIVE:1 this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wanna have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment . 
POSITIVE:1 the chateau is a risky venture that never quite goes where you expect and often surprises you with unexpected comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 it took 19 predecessors to get this ? 
POSITIVE:1 the story is virtually impossible to follow here , but there's a certain style and wit to the dialogue . 
POSITIVE:1 consummate actor barry has done excellent work here . 
NEGATIVE:0 at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow . 
NEGATIVE:0 a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can take infantile humor . . . but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer's diapers . 
POSITIVE:1 you'd have to be a most hard-hearted person not to be moved by this drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 kurys never shows why , of all the period's volatile romantic lives , sand and musset are worth particular attention . 
NEGATIVE:0 glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism . 
NEGATIVE:0 sushi for the connoisseurs of the macabre . 
POSITIVE:1 ferrara's best film in years . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . 
POSITIVE:1 arteta paints a picture of lives lived in a state of quiet desperation . 
NEGATIVE:0 when your subject is illusion versus reality , shouldn't the reality seem at least passably real ? 
NEGATIVE:0 screenwriter dan schneider and director shawn levy substitute volume and primary colors for humor and bite . 
POSITIVE:1 an old-fashioned drama of substance about a teacher's slide down the slippery slope of dishonesty after an encounter with the rich and the powerful who have nothing but disdain for virtue . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
POSITIVE:1 at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story . however , it lacks grandeur and that epic quality often associated with stevenson's tale as well as with earlier disney efforts . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's sweet . . . but just a little bit too precious at the start and a little too familiar at the end . 
POSITIVE:1 a love for films shines through each frame and the era is recreated with obvious affection , scored to perfection with some tasty boogaloo beats . 
NEGATIVE:0 de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
POSITIVE:1 kudos to the most enchanting film of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 it is ridiculous , of course . . . but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness . 
NEGATIVE:0 even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . 
NEGATIVE:0 my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
POSITIVE:1 a witty , whimsical feature debut . 
POSITIVE:1 whether kiss is a future cult classic or destined to be completely forgotten is open to question , but the risk-takers in the crowd should check it out and form their own opinion . 
NEGATIVE:0 only those most addicted to film violence in all its forms will find anything here to appreciate . 
NEGATIVE:0 the action clichés just pile up . 
POSITIVE:1 a passionately inquisitive film determined to uncover the truth and hopefully inspire action . 
POSITIVE:1 entertains by providing good , lively company . 
POSITIVE:1 birthday girl walks a tricky tightrope between being wickedly funny and just plain wicked . 
NEGATIVE:0 demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . 
NEGATIVE:0 a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
NEGATIVE:0 its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
POSITIVE:1 macdowell , whose wifty southern charm has anchored lighter affairs . . . brings an absolutely riveting conviction to her role . 
NEGATIVE:0 a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
POSITIVE:1 while the film is not entirely successful , it still manages to string together enough charming moments to work . 
NEGATIVE:0 even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
NEGATIVE:0 without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor's home videos . 
POSITIVE:1 if you can read the subtitles ( the opera is sung in italian ) and you like 'masterpiece theatre' type costumes , you'll enjoy this movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 mild , meandering teen flick . 
POSITIVE:1 there's a lot to recommend read my lips . 
NEGATIVE:0 afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
NEGATIVE:0 it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
NEGATIVE:0 dull , a road-trip movie that's surprisingly short of both adventure and song . 
NEGATIVE:0 a tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship . 
POSITIVE:1 finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original . 
NEGATIVE:0 been there done that . 
NEGATIVE:0 director chris eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking . 
NEGATIVE:0 mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
NEGATIVE:0 while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . 
NEGATIVE:0 there aren't many laughs in this interesting study of the cultural mores of georgian jews in tel aviv . 
NEGATIVE:0 don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is . 
NEGATIVE:0 what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ? 
NEGATIVE:0 the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's just no currency in deriding james bond for being a clichéd , doddering , misogynistic boy's club . 
POSITIVE:1 i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off . 
NEGATIVE:0 it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women . 
NEGATIVE:0 has no reason to exist , other than to employ hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents . 
POSITIVE:1 genuinely touching because it's realistic about all kinds of love . 
POSITIVE:1 the emotion is impressively true for being so hot-blooded , and both leads are up to the task . 
POSITIVE:1 a well-crafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity . 
POSITIVE:1 the urban landscapes are detailed down to the signs on the kiosks , and the color palette , with lots of somber blues and pinks , is dreamy and evocative . 
NEGATIVE:0 romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed . 
POSITIVE:1 the best thing the film does is to show us not only what that mind looks like , but how the creative process itself operates . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film contains no good jokes , no good scenes , barely a moment when carvey's saturday night live-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching queen of the damned is like reading a research paper , with special effects tossed in . 
POSITIVE:1 attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage . 
POSITIVE:1 gets under the skin of a man who has just lost his wife . 
NEGATIVE:0 apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film . 
POSITIVE:1 slight but enjoyable documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 the success of undercover brother is found in its ability to spoof both black and white stereotypes equally . 
NEGATIVE:0 even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation cannot engage . 
NEGATIVE:0 [t]he ideas of revolution #9 are more compelling than the execution
NEGATIVE:0 everything is off . 
POSITIVE:1 a yarn that respects the marvel version without becoming ensnared by it . 
POSITIVE:1 a properly spooky film about the power of spirits to influence us whether we believe in them or not . 
NEGATIVE:0 screenwriter chris ver weil's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability . 
POSITIVE:1 mostly martha could have used a little trimming -- 10 or 15 minutes could be cut and no one would notice -- but it's a pleasurable trifle . the only pain you'll feel as the credits roll is your stomach grumbling for some tasty grub . 
NEGATIVE:0 a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
NEGATIVE:0 is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ? i don't think so . nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me . 
POSITIVE:1 neither the funniest film that eddie murphy nor robert de niro has ever made , showtime is nevertheless efficiently amusing for a good while . before it collapses into exactly the kind of buddy cop comedy it set out to lampoon , anyway . 
POSITIVE:1 a hypnotic portrait of this sad , compulsive life . 
POSITIVE:1 adaptation is intricately constructed and in a strange way nails all of orlean's themes without being a true adaptation of her book . 
NEGATIVE:0 high crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , morgan freeman and ashley judd . 
POSITIVE:1 it is inspirational in characterizing how people from such diverse cultures share the same human and spiritual needs . 
NEGATIVE:0 the latest vapid actor's exercise to appropriate the structure of arthur schnitzler's reigen . 
NEGATIVE:0 just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . 
NEGATIVE:0 horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
POSITIVE:1 for its seriousness , high literary aspirations and stunning acting , the film can only be applauded . 
POSITIVE:1 another trumpet blast that there may be a new mexican cinema a-bornin' . 
POSITIVE:1 all in all , an interesting look at the life of the campaign-trail press , especially ones that don't really care for the candidate they're forced to follow . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in bridget jones's diary . 
POSITIVE:1 a good thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is impressive for the sights and sounds of the wondrous beats the world has to offer . 
POSITIVE:1 claire is a terrific role for someone like judd , who really ought to be playing villains . 
POSITIVE:1 this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences . 
POSITIVE:1 for a debut film , skin of man , heart of beast feels unusually assured . 
NEGATIVE:0 a painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than clyde barrow's car . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie enters a realm where few non-porn films venture , and comes across as darkly funny , energetic , and surprisingly gentle . 
POSITIVE:1 we've seen the hippie-turned-yuppie plot before , but there's an enthusiastic charm in <i ? fire that makes the formula fresh again . 
NEGATIVE:0 skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
NEGATIVE:0 a low-budget affair , tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction . then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed . 
NEGATIVE:0 to work , love stories require the full emotional involvement and support of a viewer . that is made almost impossible by events that set the plot in motion . 
POSITIVE:1 occasionally funny and consistently odd , and it works reasonably well as a star vehicle for zhao . 
NEGATIVE:0 the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
NEGATIVE:0 been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . 
NEGATIVE:0 fails to bring as much to the table . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time . 
NEGATIVE:0 swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
NEGATIVE:0 i don't think i laughed out loud once . and when you're talking about a slapstick comedy , that's a pretty big problem . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is standard crime drama fare . . . instantly forgettable and thoroughly dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation . 
NEGATIVE:0 strident and inelegant in its 'message-movie' posturing . 
NEGATIVE:0 it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . " interview " loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into . 
POSITIVE:1 not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies . 
NEGATIVE:0 as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . 
POSITIVE:1 birthday girl lucks out with chaplin and kidman , who are capable of anteing up some movie star charisma when they need it to sell us on this twisted love story , but who can also negotiate the movie's darker turns . 
POSITIVE:1 it's hard to imagine anybody ever being " in the mood " to view a movie as harrowing and painful as the grey zone , but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started . 
POSITIVE:1 sparse but oddly compelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 the jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail . 
POSITIVE:1 the story that emerges has elements of romance , tragedy and even silent-movie comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so . 
POSITIVE:1 an oddity , to be sure , but one that you might wind up remembering with a degree of affection rather than revulsion . 
POSITIVE:1 writer-director's mehta's effort has tons of charm and the whimsy is in the mixture , the intoxicating masala , of cultures and film genres . 
NEGATIVE:0 hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old's suicidal poetry . 
NEGATIVE:0 a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
NEGATIVE:0 manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
POSITIVE:1 so young , so smart , such talent , such a wise * * * . 
POSITIVE:1 abderrahmane sissako's heremakono ( waiting for happiness ) is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the west african coast struggling against foreign influences . 
NEGATIVE:0 a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . 
NEGATIVE:0 call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
NEGATIVE:0 this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips . 
NEGATIVE:0 a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . 
POSITIVE:1 the message is that even the most unlikely can link together to conquer all kinds of obstacles , whether they be of nature , of man or of one another . 
POSITIVE:1 ice age won't drop your jaw , but it will warm your heart , and i'm giving it a strong thumbs up . 
NEGATIVE:0 a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is really just another genre picture . 
POSITIVE:1 exploits [headbanger] stereotypes in good fun , while adding a bit of heart and unsettling subject matter . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're not totally weirded- out by the notion of cinema as community-therapy spectacle , quitting hits home with disorienting force . 
NEGATIVE:0 like shave ice without the topping , this cinematic snow cone is as innocuous as it is flavorless . 
POSITIVE:1 a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities . 
NEGATIVE:0 because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own . 
NEGATIVE:0 the impulses that produced this project . . . are commendable , but the results are uneven . 
POSITIVE:1 scherfig , the writer-director , has made a film so unabashedly hopeful that it actually makes the heart soar . yes , soar . 
POSITIVE:1 miyazaki's nonstop images are so stunning , and his imagination so vivid , that the only possible complaint you could have about spirited away is that there is no rest period , no timeout . 
POSITIVE:1 not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is way too full of itself ; it's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-oscar kind of way . 
NEGATIVE:0 only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
POSITIVE:1 a beautiful , timeless and universal tale of heated passions -- jealousy , betrayal , forgiveness and murder . 
NEGATIVE:0 an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
POSITIVE:1 affectionately reminds us that , in any language , the huge stuff in life can usually be traced back to the little things . 
NEGATIVE:0 no aspirations to social import inform the movie version . this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . 
NEGATIVE:0 don't even bother to rent this on video . 
NEGATIVE:0 confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . 
POSITIVE:1 berling and béart . . . continue to impress , and isabelle huppert . . . again shows uncanny skill in getting under the skin of her characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 this one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit . 
POSITIVE:1 changing lanes is an anomaly for a hollywood movie ; it's a well-written and occasionally challenging social drama that actually has something interesting to say . 
POSITIVE:1 the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups . 
POSITIVE:1 a highly personal look at the effects of living a dysfunctionally privileged lifestyle , and by the end , we only wish we could have spent more time in its world . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast . . . keeps this pretty watchable , and casting mick jagger as director of the escort service was inspired . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
NEGATIVE:0 boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon . 
NEGATIVE:0 the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . 
POSITIVE:1 an enthralling , playful film that constantly frustrates our desire to know the 'truth' about this man , while deconstructing the very format of the biography in a manner that derrida would doubtless give his blessing to . 
NEGATIVE:0 a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
NEGATIVE:0 fans of the tv series will be disappointed , and everyone else will be slightly bored . 
NEGATIVE:0 secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
POSITIVE:1 as a first-time director , paxton has tapped something in himself as an actor that provides frailty with its dark soul . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
POSITIVE:1 complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong . 
NEGATIVE:0 a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're content with a clever pseudo-bio that manages to have a good time as it doles out pieces of the famous director's life , eisenstein delivers . 
POSITIVE:1 [ramsay] visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art , music and metaphor . 
NEGATIVE:0 a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
NEGATIVE:0 an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . 
NEGATIVE:0 a small fortune in salaries and stunt cars might have been saved if the director , tom dey , had spliced together bits and pieces of midnight run and 48 hours ( and , for that matter , shrek ) . 
NEGATIVE:0 quite frankly , i can't see why any actor of talent would ever work in a mcculloch production again if they looked at how this movie turned out . 
POSITIVE:1 writer/ director m . night shyamalan's ability to pull together easily accessible stories that resonate with profundity is undeniable . 
NEGATIVE:0 the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
POSITIVE:1 the pianist [is] a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness remembered that we , today , can prevent its tragic waste of life . here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his life , his dignity and his music . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a rather bland affair . 
NEGATIVE:0 mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video . 
POSITIVE:1 a frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it's a tougher picture than it is . 
POSITIVE:1 an inventive , absorbing movie that's as hard to classify as it is hard to resist . 
POSITIVE:1 leave it to john sayles to take on developers , the chamber of commerce , tourism , historical pageants , and commercialism all in the same movie . . . without neglecting character development for even one minute . 
NEGATIVE:0 barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . spiced with humor ( 'i speak fluent flatula , ' advises denlopp after a rather , er , bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand ) and witty updatings ( silver's parrot has been replaced with morph , a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around ) 
POSITIVE:1 provides a satisfactory overview of the bizarre world of extreme athletes as several daredevils express their own views . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
NEGATIVE:0 the romance between the leads isn't as compelling or as believable as it should be . 
POSITIVE:1  " austin powers in goldmember " has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end . 
POSITIVE:1 edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery . 
NEGATIVE:0 barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
POSITIVE:1 gives an intriguing twist to the french coming-of-age genre . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoroughly enjoyable , heartfelt coming-of-age comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 let's face it -- there aren't many reasons anyone would want to see crossroads if they're not big fans of teen pop kitten britney spears . 
POSITIVE:1 ultimately engages less for its story of actorly existential despair than for its boundary-hopping formal innovations and glimpse into another kind of chinese 'cultural revolution . '
NEGATIVE:0 though certainly original in form , altar boys requires a taste for swamp thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score . 
POSITIVE:1 a diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of palestinian and israeli children . 
POSITIVE:1 malcolm mcdowell is cool . paul bettany is cool . paul bettany playing malcolm mcdowell ? cool . 
POSITIVE:1 davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces . 
POSITIVE:1 stage director sam mendes showcases tom hanks as a depression era hit-man in this dark tale of revenge . 
NEGATIVE:0 don't expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare gross-out comedy cycle . 
POSITIVE:1 purely propaganda , a work of unabashed hero worship , it is nonetheless -- and likely inadvertently -- a timely and invaluable implicit reminder of the role that u . s . foreign policy has played in the rise of castro . 
NEGATIVE:0 there may have been a good film in " trouble every day , " but it is not what is on the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
NEGATIVE:0 cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy . 
POSITIVE:1 claude chabrol has here a thriller without thrills , but that's okay . 
POSITIVE:1 [hayek] throws herself into this dream hispanic role with a teeth-clenching gusto , she strikes a potent chemistry with molina and she gradually makes us believe she is kahlo . 
NEGATIVE:0 instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized . 
POSITIVE:1 if you don't flee , you might be seduced . if you don't laugh , flee . 
POSITIVE:1 nair's cast is so large it's altman-esque , but she deftly spins the multiple stories in a vibrant and intoxicating fashion . 
POSITIVE:1 efficient , suitably anonymous chiller . 
NEGATIVE:0 it may be an easy swipe to take , but this barbershop just doesn't make the cut . 
NEGATIVE:0 by the final whistle you're convinced that this mean machine was a decent tv outing that just doesn't have big screen magic . 
POSITIVE:1 enjoy it for what it is ; you can hate yourself later . 
NEGATIVE:0 here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
POSITIVE:1 a modest masterpiece . 
NEGATIVE:0 nohe has made a decent 'intro' documentary , but he feels like a spectator and not a participant . 
NEGATIVE:0 we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting . 
POSITIVE:1 this nickleby thing might have more homosexual undertones than an eddie murphy film . and just when you think it can't get any more gay , in pops nathan lane . 
NEGATIVE:0 sadly , hewitt's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a quietly introspective portrait of the self-esteem of employment and the shame of losing a job . . . 
POSITIVE:1 a captivating new film . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing about this movie works . 
POSITIVE:1 a quirky comedy set in newfoundland that cleverly captures the dry wit that's so prevalent on the rock . 
NEGATIVE:0 lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck . 
POSITIVE:1 a wonderful character-based comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only thing i laughed at were the people who paid to see it . 
POSITIVE:1 unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such 'have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz . 
POSITIVE:1 provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust . 
POSITIVE:1 sad to say -- it accurately reflects the rage and alienation that fuels the self-destructiveness of many young people . 
POSITIVE:1 time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
NEGATIVE:0 there are now two signs that m . night shyamalan's debut feature sucked up all he has to give to the mystic genres of cinema : unbreakable and signs . 
NEGATIVE:0 so brisk is wang's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe . 
NEGATIVE:0 if myers decides to make another austin powers movie , maybe he should just stick with austin and dr evil . 
NEGATIVE:0 after a while , hoffman's quirks and mannerisms , particularly his penchant for tearing up on cue -- things that seem so real in small doses -- become annoying and artificial . 
NEGATIVE:0 a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . 
NEGATIVE:0 one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay . 
POSITIVE:1 one of [herzog's] least inspired works . 
NEGATIVE:0 moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured . 
POSITIVE:1 mr . spielberg and his company just want you to enjoy yourselves without feeling conned . and they succeed merrily at their noble endeavor . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one . 
POSITIVE:1 whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
POSITIVE:1 with few respites , marshall keeps the energy humming , and his edits , unlike those in moulin rouge , are crisp and purposeful without overdoing it . 
NEGATIVE:0 when the precise nature of matthew's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up . 
NEGATIVE:0 that zhang would make such a strainingly cute film -- with a blind orphan at its center , no less -- indicates where his ambitions have wandered . 
POSITIVE:1 while surprisingly sincere , this average little story is adorned with some awesome action photography and surfing . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . 
NEGATIVE:0 i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
POSITIVE:1 windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the most splendid entertainments to emerge from the french film industry in years . 
POSITIVE:1 the locations go from stark desert to gorgeous beaches . the story plays out slowly , but the characters are intriguing and realistic . 
POSITIVE:1 though an important political documentary , this does not really make the case the kissinger should be tried as a war criminal . 
POSITIVE:1 like the full monty , this is sure to raise audience's spirits and leave them singing long after the credits roll . 
POSITIVE:1 steve irwin's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume . 
POSITIVE:1 jason patric and ray liotta make for one splendidly cast pair . 
NEGATIVE:0 oedekerk mugs mercilessly , and the genuinely funny jokes are few and far between . 
POSITIVE:1 for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . for a film that's being advertised as a comedy , sweet home alabama isn't as funny as you'd hoped . 
POSITIVE:1 once again , director jackson strikes a rewarding balance between emotion on the human scale and action/effects on the spectacular scale . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those films that started with a great premise and then just fell apart . 
POSITIVE:1 absorbing character study by andré turpin . 
NEGATIVE:0 the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom . 
NEGATIVE:0 crush could be the worst film a man has made about women since valley of the dolls . 
POSITIVE:1 works as pretty contagious fun . 
POSITIVE:1 an exceedingly clever piece of cinema . another great ‘what you don't see' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
NEGATIVE:0 it's so badly made on every level that i'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it . 
POSITIVE:1 weird . rewarding . 
POSITIVE:1 i simply can't recommend it enough . 
POSITIVE:1 beautiful , cold , oddly colorful and just plain otherworldly , a freaky bit of art that's there to scare while we delight in the images . 
POSITIVE:1 novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach . 
POSITIVE:1 devos and cassel have tremendous chemistry -- their sexual and romantic tension , while never really vocalized , is palpable . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - arnold is not , nor will he be , back . 
NEGATIVE:0 high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue . 
NEGATIVE:0 some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one . 
POSITIVE:1 throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love's brief moment . 
NEGATIVE:0 this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
POSITIVE:1 barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful . 
POSITIVE:1 winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars . 
NEGATIVE:0 though uniformly well acted , especially by young ballesta and galan ( a first-time actor ) , writer/director achero manas's film is schematic and obvious . 
NEGATIVE:0 in its own way , joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a luis buñuel film without the latter's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of those based-on-truth stories that persuades you , with every scene , that it could never really have happened this way . 
POSITIVE:1 the modern master of the chase sequence returns with a chase to end all chases
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately feels like just one more in the long line of films this year about the business of making movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
POSITIVE:1 for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece . 
POSITIVE:1 renner carries much of the film with a creepy and dead-on performance . 
POSITIVE:1 morton deserves an oscar nomination . 
POSITIVE:1 the real triumphs in igby come from philippe , who makes oliver far more interesting than the character's lines would suggest , and sarandon , who couldn't be better as a cruel but weirdly likable wasp matron . 
POSITIVE:1 about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream . 
POSITIVE:1 strange and beautiful film . 
POSITIVE:1 hands down the year's most thought-provoking film . but it pays a price for its intricate intellectual gamesmanship . 
NEGATIVE:0 the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a fun adventure movie for kids ( of all ages ) that like adventure . 
POSITIVE:1 [reaches] wholly believable and heart-wrenching depths of despair . 
NEGATIVE:0 an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
NEGATIVE:0 director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been . 
NEGATIVE:0 elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . 
POSITIVE:1 lejos del paraíso es al mismo tiempo una fiesta para los ojos y oídos y un movilizador cuadro de personajes enfrentados a sus propios deseos , miedos y prejuicios . 
NEGATIVE:0 reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
POSITIVE:1 a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
NEGATIVE:0 'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '
POSITIVE:1 in a normal screen process , these bromides would be barely enough to sustain an interstitial program on the discovery channel . but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography . 
POSITIVE:1 by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic . 
NEGATIVE:0 draggin' about dragons
POSITIVE:1 in his latest effort , storytelling , solondz has finally made a movie that isn't just offensive -- it also happens to be good . 
NEGATIVE:0 an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . 
POSITIVE:1 succeeds as a well-made evocation of a subculture . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
NEGATIVE:0 a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks . 
POSITIVE:1 just about the best straight-up , old-school horror film of the last 15 years . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a fairly disposable yet still entertaining b picture . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved . 
POSITIVE:1 light , cute and forgettable . 
POSITIVE:1 a delicious and delicately funny look at the residents of a copenhagen neighborhood coping with the befuddling complications life tosses at them . 
NEGATIVE:0 the tale of tok ( andy lau ) , a sleek sociopath on the trail of o ( takashi sorimachi ) , the most legendary of asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l . a . beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . 
NEGATIVE:0 the first mistake , i suspect , is casting shatner as a legendary professor and kunis as a brilliant college student--where's pauly shore as the rocket scientist ? 
POSITIVE:1 rubbo runs through a remarkable amount of material in the film's short 90 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 the word that comes to mind , while watching eric rohmer's tribute to a courageous scottish lady , is painterly . 
NEGATIVE:0 payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a lovely , sad dance highlighted by kwan's unique directing style . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating , dark thriller that keeps you hooked on the delicious pulpiness of its lurid fiction . 
NEGATIVE:0 writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . 
POSITIVE:1 it is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film . 
POSITIVE:1 a remarkable 179-minute meditation on the nature of revolution . 
NEGATIVE:0 for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . 
POSITIVE:1 a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise . 
NEGATIVE:0 shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension . 
NEGATIVE:0 the piano teacher , like its title character , is repellantly out of control . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . another example of how sandler is losing his touch . 
NEGATIVE:0 every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv . 
NEGATIVE:0 producer john penotti surveyed high school students . . . and came back with the astonishing revelation that " they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them . " ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway
POSITIVE:1 the overall effect is awe and affection -- and a strange urge to get on a board and , uh , shred , dude . 
NEGATIVE:0 rarely has sex on screen been so aggressively anti-erotic . 
NEGATIVE:0 a grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone's crazy french grandfather . 
POSITIVE:1 this 90-minute postmodern voyage was more diverting and thought-provoking than i'd expected it to be . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a lovely , eerie film that casts an odd , rapt spell . 
NEGATIVE:0 whereas last year's exemplary sexy beast seemed to revitalize the british gangster movie , this equally brutal outing merely sustains it . 
NEGATIVE:0 any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
NEGATIVE:0 enduring love but exhausting cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 woody allen can write and deliver a one liner as well as anybody . but i had a lot of problems with this movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
POSITIVE:1 the komediant is a tale worth catching . 
NEGATIVE:0 [less a movie than] an appalling , odoriferous thing . . . so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you'll want to crawl up your own * * * in embarrassment . 
POSITIVE:1 it understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking . 
NEGATIVE:0 well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . 
POSITIVE:1 bolstered by exceptional performances and a clear-eyed take on the economics of dealing and the pathology of ghetto fabulousness . 
POSITIVE:1 stay clear of reminding yourself that it's a " true story " and you're likely to have one helluva time at the movies . 
POSITIVE:1 [a] satisfying niblet . 
POSITIVE:1 a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know . 
POSITIVE:1 this often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal . 
NEGATIVE:0 sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life . 
NEGATIVE:0 incoherence reigns . 
NEGATIVE:0 a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . 
NEGATIVE:0 all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters . 
NEGATIVE:0 well-nigh unendurable . . . though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
NEGATIVE:0 matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy . 
NEGATIVE:0 when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble . 
POSITIVE:1 illuminating if overly talky documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 it helps that lil bow wow . . . tones down his pint-sized gangsta act to play someone who resembles a real kid . 
POSITIVE:1 it's all a rather shapeless good time . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's impossible to even categorize this as a smutty guilty pleasure . 
POSITIVE:1 by turns very dark and very funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffers from all the excesses of the genre . 
POSITIVE:1 it is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth . 
POSITIVE:1 may be spoofing an easy target -- those old '50's giant creature features -- but . . . it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today . 
POSITIVE:1 girls gone wild and gone civil again
NEGATIVE:0 what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
NEGATIVE:0 the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
NEGATIVE:0 too silly to take seriously . 
NEGATIVE:0 this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a joke at once flaky and resonant , lightweight and bizarrely original . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . 
NEGATIVE:0 showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . 
POSITIVE:1 at its best , the good girl is a refreshingly adult take on adultery . . . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . as the story congeals you feel the pieces of the star wars saga falling into place in a way that makes your spine tingle with revelation and excitement . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby . 
POSITIVE:1 the tone is balanced , reflective and reasonable . 
NEGATIVE:0 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
NEGATIVE:0 attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 hey arnold ! the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ain't pretty . 
POSITIVE:1 shiri is an action film that delivers on the promise of excitement , but it also has a strong dramatic and emotional pull that gradually sneaks up on the audience . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating , bombshell documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger . should be required viewing for civics classes and would-be public servants alike . 
POSITIVE:1 an enthralling aesthetic experience , one that's steeped in mystery and a ravishing , baroque beauty . 
NEGATIVE:0 derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
NEGATIVE:0 for each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike tara reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout . 
POSITIVE:1 broomfield has a rather unique approach to documentary . he thinks the film is just as much a document about him as it is about the subject . 
NEGATIVE:0 the new film of anton chekhov's the cherry orchard puts the 'ick' in 'classic . '
POSITIVE:1 a clever script and skilled actors bring new energy to the familiar topic of office politics . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
NEGATIVE:0 as is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , mr . murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold . 
POSITIVE:1 the characters are more deeply thought through than in most 'right-thinking' films . 
NEGATIVE:0 swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
NEGATIVE:0 not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers . 
POSITIVE:1 you'll get the enjoyable basic minimum . but not a whit more . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
NEGATIVE:0 never does " lilo & stitch " reach the emotion or timelessness of disney's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as " mulan " or " tarzan . " 
POSITIVE:1 an extremely funny , ultimately heartbreaking look at life in contemporary china . 
NEGATIVE:0 so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . 
POSITIVE:1 it may not be history – but then again , what if it is ? – but it makes for one of the most purely enjoyable and satisfying evenings at the movies i've had in a while . 
POSITIVE:1 it doesn't make for great cinema , but it is interesting to see where one's imagination will lead when given the opportunity . 
POSITIVE:1 has a plot full of twists upon knots . . . and a nonstop parade of mock-tarantino scuzbag types that starts out clever but veers into overkill . 
NEGATIVE:0 unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you're going to feel like you weren't invited to the party . 
NEGATIVE:0 features nonsensical and laughable plotting , wooden performances , ineptly directed action sequences and some of the worst dialogue in recent memory . 
NEGATIVE:0 the first hour is tedious though ford and neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie . 
POSITIVE:1 it's funny and human and really pretty damned wonderful , all at once . 
NEGATIVE:0 director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a long way from orwell's dark , intelligent warning cry [1984] to the empty stud knockabout of equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation . 
POSITIVE:1 a marvelous performance by allison lohman as an identity-seeking foster child . 
NEGATIVE:0 impeccably filmed , sexually charged , but ultimately lacking in substance , not to mention dragged down by a leaden closing act . 
POSITIVE:1 at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 intriguing and downright intoxicating . 
POSITIVE:1 much of the movie's charm lies in the utter cuteness of stuart and margolo . their computer-animated faces are very expressive . 
POSITIVE:1 martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor . 
POSITIVE:1 reign of fire just might go down as one of the all-time great apocalypse movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 a lame romantic comedy about an unsympathetic character and someone who would not likely be so stupid as to get involved with her . 
POSITIVE:1 like a skillful fisher , the director uses the last act to reel in the audience since its poignancy hooks us completely . 
POSITIVE:1 the weakest of the four harry potter books has been transformed into the stronger of the two films by the thinnest of margins . 
POSITIVE:1 i don't feel the least bit ashamed in admitting that my enjoyment came at the expense of seeing justice served , even if it's a dish that's best served cold . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart . 
POSITIVE:1 the film sometimes flags . . . but there is enough secondary action to keep things moving along at a brisk , amusing pace . 
NEGATIVE:0 laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . 
NEGATIVE:0 the kind of spectacularly misconceived enterprise that only a sophisticated cinephile could have perpetrated . 
POSITIVE:1 not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare . 
NEGATIVE:0 so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . 
NEGATIVE:0 the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
NEGATIVE:0 apart from dazzling cinematography , we've seen just about everything in blue crush in one form or the other . 
POSITIVE:1 worth a salute just for trying to be more complex than your average film . 
NEGATIVE:0 if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
NEGATIVE:0 ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley's source novel ( about schmidt ) and an old payne screenplay . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of these days hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations . 
POSITIVE:1 even in its most tedious scenes , russian ark is mesmerizing . 
NEGATIVE:0 frenetic but not really funny . 
POSITIVE:1 nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you . he makes you realize that deep inside righteousness can be found a tough beauty . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
NEGATIVE:0 has not so much been written as assembled , frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups . 
POSITIVE:1 westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that's both saucy and endearing . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . hits every cliche we've come to expect , including the assumption that " crazy " people are innocent , childlike and inherently funny . 
POSITIVE:1 a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown . 
POSITIVE:1 this is more fascinating -- being real -- than anything seen on jerry springer . 
NEGATIVE:0 [at least] moore is a real charmer . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self… this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
POSITIVE:1 exciting and well-paced . 
POSITIVE:1 labute masterfully balances both traditional or modern stories together in a manner that one never overwhelms the other . something for everyone . 
POSITIVE:1 this is so de palma . if you love him , you'll like it . if you don't . . . well , skip to another review . 
POSITIVE:1 divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
POSITIVE:1 together writer-director danny verete's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt . 
NEGATIVE:0 although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks . 
NEGATIVE:0 a living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange . the fact that it isn't very good is almost beside the point . 
POSITIVE:1 while somewhat less than it might have been , the film is a good one , and you've got to hand it to director george clooney for biting off such a big job the first time out . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths . entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
NEGATIVE:0 as pedestrian as they come . 
NEGATIVE:0 director kevin bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the " miami vice " checklist of power boats , latin music and dog tracks . he doesn't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show's trademark style and flash . 
POSITIVE:1 jolting into charleston rhythms , the story has the sizzle of old news that has finally found the right vent ( accurate ? who cares ? ) . 
POSITIVE:1 elling really is about a couple of crazy guys , and it's therapeutic to laugh along with them . 
POSITIVE:1 a worthwhile documentary , whether you're into rap or not , even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll . 
NEGATIVE:0 the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn . 
NEGATIVE:0 if it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in dolby digital stereo . if nothing else , " rollerball " 2002 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by ll cool j . 
POSITIVE:1 fans of the modern day hong kong action film finally have the worthy successor to a better tomorrow and the killer which they have been patiently waiting for . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is a verbal duel between two gifted performers . 
POSITIVE:1 not a film to rival to live , but a fine little amuse-bouche to keep your appetite whetted . 
NEGATIVE:0 you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous . 
NEGATIVE:0 velocity represents everything wrong with ''independent film'' as a commodified , sold-out concept on the american filmmaking scene . 
POSITIVE:1 for the most part stevens glides through on some solid performances and witty dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 cacoyannis' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts . 
POSITIVE:1 a rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love . 
POSITIVE:1 the sentimental cliches mar an otherwise excellent film . a powerful performance from mel gibson and a brutal 90-minute battle sequence that does everything but issue you a dog-tag and an m-16 . 
POSITIVE:1 splendidly illustrates the ability of the human spirit to overcome adversity . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything in maid in manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend . it goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste . 
NEGATIVE:0 could the country bears really be as bad as its trailers ? in a word -- yes . 
NEGATIVE:0 the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
POSITIVE:1 a pleasant enough movie , held together by skilled ensemble actors . 
POSITIVE:1 enormously enjoyable , high-adrenaline documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 for his first attempt at film noir , spielberg presents a fascinating but flawed look at the near future . 
POSITIVE:1 reggio's continual visual barrage is absorbing as well as thought-provoking . 
POSITIVE:1 behind the snow games and lovable siberian huskies ( plus one sheep dog ) , the picture hosts a parka-wrapped dose of heart . 
POSITIVE:1 alternately hilarious and sad , aggravating and soulful , scathing and joyous . it's a masterpeice . 
NEGATIVE:0 we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not a great monster movie . but if you've paid a matinee price and bought a big tub of popcorn , there's guilty fun to be had here . chomp chomp ! 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie
POSITIVE:1 halloween : resurrection isn't exactly quality cinema , but it isn't nearly as terrible as it cold have been . 
NEGATIVE:0 theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
POSITIVE:1  . . . in no way original , or even all that memorable , but as downtown saturday matinee brain candy , it doesn't disappoint . 
NEGATIVE:0 rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is one more celluloid testimonial to the cruelties experienced by southern blacks as distilled through a caucasian perspective . 
POSITIVE:1 feral and uncomfortable . 
NEGATIVE:0 a science-fiction pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its inspirations there would be precious little left . 
NEGATIVE:0 aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
NEGATIVE:0 one suspects that craven endorses they simply because this movie makes his own look much better by comparison . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a rollicking adventure for you and all your mateys , regardless of their ages . 
POSITIVE:1 if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right . 
NEGATIVE:0 worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
POSITIVE:1 i like it . there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane . 
NEGATIVE:0 a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
POSITIVE:1 rarely has skin looked as beautiful , desirable , even delectable , as it does in trouble every day . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's plenty of style in guillermo del toro's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply can't sustain more than 90 minutes .

POSITIVE:1  . . . myers has turned his franchise into the movie version of an adolescent dirty-joke book done up in post-tarantino pop-culture riffs . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . 
POSITIVE:1 for most of its footage , the new thriller proves that director m . night shyamalan can weave an eerie spell and that mel gibson can gasp , shudder and even tremble without losing his machismo . 
POSITIVE:1 watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving and important film . 
POSITIVE:1 a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .

NEGATIVE:0 outside of burger's desire to make some kind of film , it's really unclear why this project was undertaken
NEGATIVE:0 there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture .

POSITIVE:1 what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale – as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters .

NEGATIVE:0 one of the worst films of 2002 . 
POSITIVE:1 fulford-wierzbicki . . . deftly captures the wise-beyond-her-years teen . 
NEGATIVE:0 gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid . . . a curiously constricted epic . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the " webcast . " 
NEGATIVE:0 if the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic heaven will quite likely be more like hell . 
POSITIVE:1 this is lightweight filmmaking , to be sure , but it's pleasant enough -- and oozing with attractive men . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .

POSITIVE:1 overall , it's a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love . 
POSITIVE:1 alain choquart's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating . 
POSITIVE:1 spielberg's picture is smarter and subtler than [total recall and blade runner] , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .

POSITIVE:1 a dazzling dream of a documentary .

NEGATIVE:0 so devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like xxx and collateral damage seem like thoughtful treatises
NEGATIVE:0 at a brief 42 minutes , we need more x and less blab . 
POSITIVE:1 writer-director juan carlos fresnadillo makes a feature debut that is fully formed and remarkably assured . 
POSITIVE:1 we know the plot's a little crazy , but it held my interest from start to finish . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film itself is about something very interesting and odd that would probably work better as a real documentary without the insinuation of mediocre acting or a fairly trite narrative .

NEGATIVE:0 a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash .

POSITIVE:1 holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks . 
POSITIVE:1 though the violence is far less sadistic than usual , the film is typical miike : fast , furious and full of off-the-cuff imaginative flourishes . 
POSITIVE:1 jacquot's strategy allows his cast the benefit of being able to give full performances . . . while demonstrating vividly that the beauty and power of the opera reside primarily in the music itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's messages of tolerance and diversity aren't particularly original , but one can't help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 'pocas ideas interesantes , un final pseudo místico que no corresponde al tono general del filme y que deja una sensación de inconformidad que hace pensar más de una vez si vale la pena ir a la taquilla y reclamar el precio del boleto . '

NEGATIVE:0 the script boasts some tart tv-insider humor , but the film has not a trace of humanity or empathy . 
NEGATIVE:0 heavy-handed exercise in time-vaulting literary pretension . 
POSITIVE:1 with a large cast representing a broad cross-section , tavernier's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of " his girl friday , " maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes .

POSITIVE:1 a special kind of movie , this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as pulp fiction and get shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , who is cletis tout ? is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche . 
POSITIVE:1 gives us a lot to chew on , but not all of it has been properly digested . 
POSITIVE:1 a vivid cinematic portrait . 
POSITIVE:1 this familiar rise-and-fall tale is long on glamour and short on larger moralistic consequences , though it's told with sharp ears and eyes for the tenor of the times .

NEGATIVE:0 if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . 
POSITIVE:1 it has its faults , but it is a kind , unapologetic , sweetheart of a movie , and mandy moore leaves a positive impression .

POSITIVE:1 e . t . works because its flabbergasting principals , 14-year-old robert macnaughton , 6-year-old drew barrymore and 10-year-old henry thomas , convince us of the existence of the wise , wizened visitor from a faraway planet . 
NEGATIVE:0 herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance .

POSITIVE:1 turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . 
NEGATIVE:0 mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious . 
POSITIVE:1 a triumph , a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light . 
NEGATIVE:0 it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie .

POSITIVE:1 the re-release of ron howard's apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really , really , really good things can come in enormous packages .

NEGATIVE:0 plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of john waters and todd solondz , rather than a fully developed story . 
POSITIVE:1 dense and thoughtful and brimming with ideas that are too complex to be rapidly absorbed . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself . 
NEGATIVE:0 julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
NEGATIVE:0 a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
POSITIVE:1 the grey zone gives voice to a story that needs to be heard in the sea of holocaust movies . . . but the film suffers from its own difficulties . 
NEGATIVE:0 another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
NEGATIVE:0 analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . 
POSITIVE:1 a portrait of hell so shattering it's impossible to shake . 
NEGATIVE:0 lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year . 
NEGATIVE:0 had the film boasted a clearer , more memorable , the creepiness would have gotten under the skin . 
POSITIVE:1 with the same sort of good-natured fun found in films like tremors , eight legged freaks is prime escapist fare . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive . 
POSITIVE:1 the ending does leave you unfulfilled , but these are performances to enjoy in a memorable ensemble piece . 
POSITIVE:1 very psychoanalytical -- provocatively so -- and also refreshingly literary . 
NEGATIVE:0 a selection of scenes in search of a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 keenly observed and refreshingly natural , swimming gets the details right , from its promenade of barely clad bodies in myrtle beach , s . c . , to the adrenaline jolt of a sudden lunch rush at the diner . 
POSITIVE:1  " what really happened ? " is a question for philosophers , not filmmakers ; all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a beautiful film , full of elaborate and twisted characters - and it's also pretty funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados . 
POSITIVE:1 elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy . 
NEGATIVE:0 [i]t's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but barbershop isn't as funny as it should be . 
POSITIVE:1 leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago . 
NEGATIVE:0 the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness . 
POSITIVE:1 same song , second verse , coulda been better , but it coulda been worse . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] slummer . 
POSITIVE:1 an excellent romp that boasts both a heart and a mind . 
NEGATIVE:0 doesn't offer much besides glib soullessness , raunchy language and a series of brutal set pieces . . . that raise the bar on stylized screen violence . 
NEGATIVE:0 while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw . 
POSITIVE:1 if mostly martha is mostly unsurprising , it's still a sweet , even delectable diversion . 
NEGATIVE:0 terrible . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker . 
POSITIVE:1 whatever heartwarming scene the impressively discreet filmmakers may have expected to record with their mini dv , they show a remarkable ability to document both sides of this emotional car-wreck . 
POSITIVE:1 if the plot seems a bit on the skinny side , that's because panic room is interested in nothing more than sucking you in…and making you sweat . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age/coming-out tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class . 
POSITIVE:1 although frailty fits into a classic genre , in its script and execution it is a remarkably original work . 
NEGATIVE:0 the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
NEGATIVE:0 bean drops the ball too many times . . . hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay . 
NEGATIVE:0 to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
POSITIVE:1 the subtitled costume drama is set in a remote african empire before cell phones , guns , and the internal combustion engine , but the politics that thump through it are as timely as tomorrow . 
NEGATIVE:0 walter hill's pulpy , stylized boxing melodrama undisputed nearly overcomes its questionable in-the-ring match-up with solid fight choreography and gritty prison authenticity . 
POSITIVE:1 shattering , devastating documentary on two maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral . extraordinary debut from josh koury . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world . 
POSITIVE:1 serious and thoughtful . 
NEGATIVE:0 yes , i have given this movie a rating of zero . but fans of the show should not consider this a diss . consider it 'perfection . '
NEGATIVE:0 deserving of its critical backlash and more . 
NEGATIVE:0 they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book . 
POSITIVE:1 as it turns out , you can go home again . 
NEGATIVE:0 generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . 
POSITIVE:1 that old adage about women being unknowable gets an exhilarating new interpretation in morvern callar . 
NEGATIVE:0 parker updates the setting in an attempt to make the film relevant today , without fully understanding what it was that made the story relevant in the first place . 
POSITIVE:1 simple , poignant and leavened with humor , it's a film that affirms the nourishing aspects of love and companionship . 
POSITIVE:1 buy is an accomplished actress , and this is a big , juicy role . 
POSITIVE:1 in the end , the film is less the cheap thriller you'd expect than it is a fairly revealing study of its two main characters — damaged-goods people whose orbits will inevitably and dangerously collide . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this isn't . 
NEGATIVE:0 the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
NEGATIVE:0 i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
POSITIVE:1 the film provides some great insight into the neurotic mindset of all comics -- even those who have reached the absolute top of the game . 
NEGATIVE:0 this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn . 
NEGATIVE:0 a incompetência de marcus adams como roteirista só é superada por sua péssima direção . 
NEGATIVE:0 downbeat , period-perfect biopic hammers home a heavy-handed moralistic message . 
NEGATIVE:0 reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism , with repetition and languorous slo-mo sequences , that glass's dirgelike score becomes a fang-baring lullaby . 
NEGATIVE:0 just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name . 
POSITIVE:1 australian filmmaker david flatman uses the huge-screen format to make an old-fashioned nature film that educates viewers with words and pictures while entertaining them . 
NEGATIVE:0 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it . 
NEGATIVE:0  " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . 
POSITIVE:1 what's so fun about this silly , outrageous , ingenious thriller is the director's talent . watching a brian depalma movie is like watching an alfred hitchcock movie after drinking twelve beers . 
POSITIVE:1 an emotionally and spiritually compelling journey seen through the right eyes , with the right actors and with the kind of visual flair that shows what great cinema can really do . 
NEGATIVE:0 by the end of it all i sort of loved the people onscreen , even though i could not stand them . perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter . it's not an easy one to review . 
NEGATIVE:0 a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . 
POSITIVE:1 'tobey maguire is a poster boy for the geek generation . '
POSITIVE:1 although melodramatic and predictable , this romantic comedy explores the friendship between five filipino-americans and their frantic efforts to find love . 
NEGATIVE:0 definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . 
POSITIVE:1 a resonant tale of racism , revenge and retribution . 
POSITIVE:1 escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are weird resonances between actor and role here , and they're not exactly flattering . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart , steamy mix of road movie , coming-of-age story and political satire . 
NEGATIVE:0 to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
POSITIVE:1 the year's greatest adventure , and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate . 
NEGATIVE:0 largely a for-fans artifact . 
NEGATIVE:0 a better title , for all concerned , might be swept under the rug . 
POSITIVE:1 proof once again that if the filmmakers just follow the books , they can't go wrong . better effects , better acting and a hilarious kenneth branagh . an excellent sequel . 
POSITIVE:1 what " empire " lacks in depth it makes up for with its heart . 
NEGATIVE:0 it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up . 
POSITIVE:1 a searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise . 
POSITIVE:1 a dashing and absorbing outing with one of france's most inventive directors . 
POSITIVE:1 as a singular character study , it's perfect . it's also the year's sweetest movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 most of the action setups are incoherent . 
POSITIVE:1 the fun of the movie is the chance it affords to watch jackson , who also served as executive producer , take his smooth , shrewd , powerful act abroad . 
NEGATIVE:0 [morgan] , judd and franklin can't save the script , rooted in a novel by joseph finder , from some opportunism . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is really closer to porn than a serious critique of what's wrong with this increasingly pervasive aspect of gay culture . 
NEGATIVE:0 maid in manhattan proves that it's easier to change the sheets than to change hackneyed concepts when it comes to dreaming up romantic comedies . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's clear why deuces wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on mgm's shelf . 
POSITIVE:1 filmmaker stacy peralta has a flashy editing style that doesn't always jell with sean penn's monotone narration , but he respects the material without sentimentalizing it . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . while the humor aspects of 'jason x' were far more entertaining than i had expected , everything else about the film tanks . 
POSITIVE:1 a gentle and engrossing character study . 
NEGATIVE:0 terminally brain dead production . 
NEGATIVE:0 has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flim-flam inventiveness . 
POSITIVE:1 even if the ring has a familiar ring , it's still unusually crafty and intelligent for hollywood horror . 
NEGATIVE:0 first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
NEGATIVE:0 the film is surprisingly well-directed by brett ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act . 
POSITIVE:1 too much of storytelling moves away from solondz's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur's professional injuries . 
POSITIVE:1 awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over . 
POSITIVE:1 reign of fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond road warrior , it owes enormous debts to aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
POSITIVE:1 may not be a breakthrough in filmmaking , but it is unwavering and arresting . 
POSITIVE:1 there is something that is so meditative and lyrical about babak payami's boldly quirky iranian drama secret ballot . . . a charming and evoking little ditty that manages to show the gentle and humane side of middle eastern world politics
NEGATIVE:0 wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
POSITIVE:1 the film fits into a genre that has been overexposed , redolent of a thousand cliches , and yet remains uniquely itself , vibrant with originality . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
NEGATIVE:0 stay away . far away . 
POSITIVE:1 spend your benjamins on a matinee . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is . 
POSITIVE:1 an affectionately goofy satire that's unafraid to throw elbows when necessary . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . 
NEGATIVE:0 as crimes go , writer-director michael kalesniko's how to kill your neighbor's dog is slight but unendurable . 
NEGATIVE:0 you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled . 
NEGATIVE:0 it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
POSITIVE:1 jacquot has filmed the opera exactly as the libretto directs , ideally capturing the opera's drama and lyricism . 
NEGATIVE:0 woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
NEGATIVE:0 couldn't someone take rob schneider and have him switch bodies with a funny person ? 
NEGATIVE:0 loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . blade ii is more enjoyable than the original . 
NEGATIVE:0 avary's film never quite emerges from the shadow of ellis' book . 
POSITIVE:1 leigh's film is full of memorable performances from top to bottom . 
POSITIVE:1 has enough wit , energy and geniality to please not only the fanatical adherents on either side , but also people who know nothing about the subject and think they're not interested . 
NEGATIVE:0 any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years . 
POSITIVE:1 it ultimately stands forth as an important chronicle of the abuses of one of latin america's most oppressive regimes . 
NEGATIVE:0 overly long and worshipful bio-doc . 
NEGATIVE:0 belongs in the too-hot-for-tv direct-to-video/dvd category , and this is why i have given it a one-star rating . 
NEGATIVE:0 theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues . 
NEGATIVE:0 the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . 
NEGATIVE:0 the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
POSITIVE:1 the ingenuity that parker displays in freshening the play is almost in a class with that of wilde himself . 
POSITIVE:1 lasker's canny , meditative script distances sex and love , as byron and luther . . . realize they can't get no satisfaction without the latter . 
POSITIVE:1 what makes barbershop so likable , with all its flaws , is that it has none of the pushiness and decibel volume of most contemporary comedies . 
POSITIVE:1 as unseemly as its title suggests . 
NEGATIVE:0 been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
NEGATIVE:0 a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
POSITIVE:1 from the big giant titles of the opening credits to elmer bernstein's perfectly melodic score , haynes gets just about everything right . 
NEGATIVE:0 can't seem to get anywhere near the story's center . 
POSITIVE:1 brown sugar signals director rick famuyiwa's emergence as an articulate , grown-up voice in african-american cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs . 
POSITIVE:1 those who don't entirely 'get' godard's distinctive discourse will still come away with a sense of his reserved but existential poignancy . 
POSITIVE:1 a portrait of an artist . 
POSITIVE:1 instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
NEGATIVE:0 not exactly the bees knees
POSITIVE:1 although shot with little style , skins is heartfelt and achingly real . 
NEGATIVE:0 k-19 exploits our substantial collective fear of nuclear holocaust to generate cheap hollywood tension . 
NEGATIVE:0 topkapi this is not . 
NEGATIVE:0 uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
POSITIVE:1 it works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory . 
NEGATIVE:0 by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome . and it sees those relationships , including that between the son and his wife , and the wife and the father , and between the two brothers , with incredible subtlety and acumen . 
POSITIVE:1 a highly spirited , imaginative kid's movie that broaches neo-augustinian theology : is god stuck in heaven because he's afraid of his best-known creation ? 
POSITIVE:1 in many ways , reminiscent of 1992's unforgiven which also utilized the scintillating force of its actors to draw out the menace of its sparse dialogue . 
POSITIVE:1 carrying off a spot-on scottish burr , duvall ( also a producer ) peels layers from this character that may well not have existed on paper . 
POSITIVE:1 imagine a scenario where bergman approaches swedish fatalism using gary larson's far side humor
NEGATIVE:0 an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
NEGATIVE:0 neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . 
NEGATIVE:0 moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a nicely handled affair , a film about human darkness but etched with a light ( yet unsentimental ) touch . 
NEGATIVE:0 i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . 
POSITIVE:1 for all its problems . . . the lady and the duke surprisingly manages never to grow boring . . . which proves that rohmer still has a sense of his audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat . 
NEGATIVE:0 director uwe boll and writer robert dean klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , cannot overcome blah characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 kim ki-deok seems to have in mind an ( emotionally at least ) adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested . 
POSITIVE:1 [chaiken's] talent lies in an evocative , accurate observation of a distinctive milieu and in the lively , convincing dialogue she creates for her characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished . 
POSITIVE:1 if s&m seems like a strange route to true love , maybe it is , but it's to this film's ( and its makers' ) credit that we believe that that's exactly what these two people need to find each other -- and themselves . 
NEGATIVE:0 sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
POSITIVE:1 filmmaker tian zhuangzhuang triumphantly returns to narrative filmmaking with a visually masterful work of quiet power . 
POSITIVE:1 few films capture so perfectly the hopes and dreams of little boys on baseball fields as well as the grown men who sit in the stands . 
POSITIVE:1 maintains your interest until the end and even leaves you with a few lingering animated thoughts . 
NEGATIVE:0 birot's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré ) isn't so much bad as it is bland . 
POSITIVE:1 the quality of the art combined with the humor and intelligence of the script allow the filmmakers to present the biblical message of forgiveness without it ever becoming preachy or syrupy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script has less spice than a rat burger and the rock's fighting skills are more in line with steven seagal . 
NEGATIVE:0 suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum . punish the vehicle to adore the star . 
NEGATIVE:0 cox is far more concerned with aggrandizing madness , not the man , and the results might drive you crazy . 
NEGATIVE:0 an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
POSITIVE:1 pretty good little movie . 
POSITIVE:1 rich in atmosphere of the post-war art world , it manages to instruct without reeking of research library dust . 
POSITIVE:1 cuts right through the b . s . giving a big middle-fingered " shut up " to those who talk up what is nothing more than two guys beating the hell outta one another . 
NEGATIVE:0 your stomach for heaven depends largely on your appetite for canned corn . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
NEGATIVE:0 a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
POSITIVE:1 still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at 'face value' to recommend to anyone looking for something different . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think . 
POSITIVE:1 graced with the kind of social texture and realism that would be foreign in american teen comedies . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is well crafted , and well executed . if you're paying attention , the " big twists " are pretty easy to guess - but that doesn't make the movie any less entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 too clever by about nine-tenths . 
NEGATIVE:0 lots of effort and intelligence are on display but in execution it is all awkward , static , and lifeless rumblings . 
POSITIVE:1 you emerge dazed , confused as to whether you've seen pornography or documentary . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
NEGATIVE:0 [it's] a prison soccer movie starring charismatic tough guy vinnie jones , but it had too much spitting for me to enjoy . 
NEGATIVE:0 it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
POSITIVE:1 a burst of color , music , and dance that only the most practiced curmudgeon could fail to crack a smile at . 
NEGATIVE:0 when cowering and begging at the feet a scruffy giannini , madonna gives her best performance since abel ferrara had her beaten to a pulp in his dangerous game . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . 
POSITIVE:1 if anything , the film is doing something of a public service -- shedding light on a group of extremely talented musicians who might otherwise go unnoticed and underappreciated by music fans . 
POSITIVE:1 for the first time in several years , mr . allen has surpassed himself with the magic he's spun with the hollywood empress of ms . leoni's ellie . 
POSITIVE:1 tsai has managed to create an underplayed melodrama about family dynamics and dysfunction that harks back to the spare , unchecked heartache of yasujiro ozu . 
POSITIVE:1 the son of the bride's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also isn't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues . this movie is to be cherished . 
NEGATIVE:0 'a' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 'this movie sucks . '
NEGATIVE:0 a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . 
POSITIVE:1 uneven but a lot of fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 a by-the-numbers patient/doctor pic that covers all the usual ground
NEGATIVE:0 this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . 
POSITIVE:1 between the drama of cube ? s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results . 
POSITIVE:1 stock up on silver bullets for director neil marshall's intense freight train of a film . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is darkly atmospheric , with herrmann quietly suggesting the sadness and obsession beneath hearst's forced avuncular chortles . 
NEGATIVE:0 anemic , pretentious . 
POSITIVE:1 this orange has some juice , but it's far from fresh-squeezed . 
NEGATIVE:0 fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's harmless , diverting fluff . but it's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre . 
NEGATIVE:0 a smug and convoluted action-comedy that doesn't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it's only a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 hip-hop has a history , and it's a metaphor for this love story . 
NEGATIVE:0 the master of disguise is awful . it's pauly shore awful . don't say you weren't warned . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the best films i have ever seen , constantly pulling the rug from underneath us , seeing things from new sides , plunging deeper , getting more intense . 
POSITIVE:1 smart and alert , thirteen conversations about one thing is a small gem . 
NEGATIVE:0 both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates . 
POSITIVE:1 it's tough to watch , but it's a fantastic movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
POSITIVE:1 what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness . 
NEGATIVE:0 further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . 
NEGATIVE:0 an uneven mix of dark satire and childhood awakening . 
POSITIVE:1 dogtown & z-boys evokes the blithe rebel fantasy with the kind of insouciance embedded in the sexy demise of james dean . 
POSITIVE:1 the bai brothers have taken an small slice of history and opened it up for all of us to understand , and they've told a nice little story in the process . 
NEGATIVE:0 thoroughly awful . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . 
NEGATIVE:0 almost nothing else -- raunchy and graphic as it may be in presentation -- is one-sided , outwardly sexist or mean-spirited . and in a sense , that's a liability . 
NEGATIVE:0 basically , it's pretty but dumb . 
NEGATIVE:0 an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
POSITIVE:1 ryan gosling is , in a word , brilliant as the conflicted daniel . 
POSITIVE:1 a thoughtful movie , a movie that is concerned with souls and risk and schemes and the consequences of one's actions . 
NEGATIVE:0 little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original . 
POSITIVE:1 i'd watch these two together again in a new york minute . 
POSITIVE:1 what could have easily become a cold , calculated exercise in postmodern pastiche winds up a powerful and deeply moving example of melodramatic moviemaking . 
POSITIVE:1 hatosy . . . portrays young brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship . 
POSITIVE:1 a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney . 
POSITIVE:1 watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay's sappier elements . . . and sustains off the hook's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer . 
POSITIVE:1 k 19 stays afloat as decent drama/action flick
NEGATIVE:0 audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on oprah . 
NEGATIVE:0 after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go . 
POSITIVE:1 at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best . 
POSITIVE:1 corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . it's the perfect kind of film to see when you don't want to use your brain . at all . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
POSITIVE:1 a marvel of production design . 
NEGATIVE:0 static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year . 
POSITIVE:1 though it lacks the utter authority of a genre gem , there's a certain robustness to this engaging mix of love and bloodletting . 
POSITIVE:1 both garcia and jagger turn in perfectly executed and wonderfully sympathetic characters , who are alternately touching and funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sterling film - a cross between boys don't cry , deliverance , and ode to billy joe - lies somewhere in the story of matthew shepard , but that film is yet to be made . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
POSITIVE:1 with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives . 
POSITIVE:1 the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life . 
POSITIVE:1 whether or not you buy mr . broomfield's findings , the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight , pale mr . broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover . 
NEGATIVE:0 starts as a tart little lemon drop of a movie and ends up as a bitter pill . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
NEGATIVE:0 so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something . 
POSITIVE:1 the story has some nice twists but the ending and some of the back-story is a little tired . the performances are all solid ; it merely lacks originality to make it a great movie . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its old-hat set-up and predictable plot , empire still has enough moments to keep it entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 everybody loves a david and goliath story , and this one is told almost entirely from david's point of view . 
POSITIVE:1 director-writer bille august . . . depicts this relationship with economical grace , letting his superb actors convey martin's deterioration and barbara's sadness -- and , occasionally , anger . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . 
NEGATIVE:0 best described as i know what you did last winter . 
NEGATIVE:0 wendigo wants to be a monster movie for the art-house crowd , but it falls into the trap of pretention almost every time . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
NEGATIVE:0 flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams . 
NEGATIVE:0 too slow , too long and too little happens . 
POSITIVE:1 aniston has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil . 
NEGATIVE:0 a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
NEGATIVE:0 another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . 
NEGATIVE:0 stealing harvard is evidence that the farrelly bros . -- peter and bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with green's half-hearted movie career . 
POSITIVE:1 kinnear's performance is a career-defining revelation . 
POSITIVE:1 lapaglia's ability to convey grief and hope works with weaver's sensitive reactions to make this a two-actor master class . 
NEGATIVE:0 the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them . 
NEGATIVE:0 like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long . 
NEGATIVE:0 horrible
NEGATIVE:0 a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
NEGATIVE:0 attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama . he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . 
NEGATIVE:0 skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is messy , uncouth , incomprehensible , vicious and absurd . 
POSITIVE:1 compelling revenge thriller , though somewhat weakened by a miscast leading lady . 
POSITIVE:1 a soul-stirring documentary about the israeli/palestinian conflict as revealed through the eyes of some children who remain curious about each other against all odds . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . 
POSITIVE:1 vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role . 
POSITIVE:1 a solid , psychological action film from hong kong . 
NEGATIVE:0 large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . 
POSITIVE:1 what [denis] accomplishes in his chilling , unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic , suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned . 
NEGATIVE:0 its screenplay serves as auto-critique , and its clumsiness as its own most damning censure . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling film . 
NEGATIVE:0 in trying to be daring and original , it comes off as only occasionally satirical and never fresh . 
NEGATIVE:0 pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut . 
POSITIVE:1 the power of shanghai ghetto , a documentary by dana janklowicz-mann and amir mann , rests in the voices of men and women , now in their 70s , who lived there in the 1940s . 
NEGATIVE:0 cattaneo reworks the formula that made the full monty a smashing success . . . but neglects to add the magic that made it all work . 
POSITIVE:1 possession is elizabeth barrett browning meets nancy drew , and it's directed by . . . neil labute . hmm . 
NEGATIVE:0 we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth . 
POSITIVE:1 steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches . 
POSITIVE:1 a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . 
POSITIVE:1 fontaine's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal . 
POSITIVE:1 neil burger here succeeded in . . . making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more immediate mystery in the present . 
POSITIVE:1 spiderman rocks
POSITIVE:1 sitting in the third row of the imax cinema at sydney's darling harbour , but i sometimes felt as though i was in the tiny two seater plane that carried the giant camera around australia , sweeping and gliding , banking and hovering over some of the most not
NEGATIVE:0 nothing but one relentlessly depressing situation after another for its entire running time , something that you could easily be dealing with right now in your lives . 
POSITIVE:1 notwithstanding my problem with the movie's final half hour , i'm going to recommend secretary , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by spader and gyllenhaal , and also the unique way shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl-
POSITIVE:1 the action sequences are fun and reminiscent of combat scenes from the star wars series . 
NEGATIVE:0 i like it . no , i hate it . no , i love it . . . hell , i dunno . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're not into the pokemon franchise , this fourth animated movie in four years won't convert you -- or even keep your eyes open . but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi . 
NEGATIVE:0 completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
POSITIVE:1 a whole lot foul , freaky and funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 [hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
POSITIVE:1 while most films these days are about nothing , this film seems to be about everything that's plaguing the human spirit in a relentlessly globalizing world . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness . 
POSITIVE:1 an uplifting , near-masterpiece . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a story , an old and scary one , about the monsters we make , and the vengeance they take . 
NEGATIVE:0 a moving picture that does not move . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . understands that a generation defines its music as much as the music defines a generation . 
POSITIVE:1 short-story quaint , touchingly mending a child's pain for his dead mother via communication with an old woman straight out of eudora welty . 
NEGATIVE:0 tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
NEGATIVE:0 'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
POSITIVE:1 dazzling and sugar-sweet , a blast of shallow magnificence that only sex , scandal , and a chorus line of dangerous damsels can deliver . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
NEGATIVE:0 taken as a whole , the tuxedo doesn't add up to a whole lot . 
POSITIVE:1 a whale of a good time for both children and parents seeking christian-themed fun . 
POSITIVE:1 a terrifically entertaining specimen of spielbergian sci-fi . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is an exercise not in biography but in hero worship . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
POSITIVE:1 a weird and wonderful comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 . 
POSITIVE:1 a perfectly respectable , perfectly inoffensive , easily forgettable film . 
NEGATIVE:0 two-bit potboiler . 
NEGATIVE:0 at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . 
POSITIVE:1 a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
POSITIVE:1 a mischievous visual style and oodles of charm make 'cherish' a very good ( but not great ) movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a visual spectacle full of stunning images and effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety . 
POSITIVE:1 no worse a film than breaking out , and breaking out was utterly charming . 
POSITIVE:1 seldom has a movie so closely matched the spirit of a man and his work . 
POSITIVE:1 worth the effort to watch . 
POSITIVE:1 what saves this deeply affecting film from being merely a collection of wrenching cases is corcuera's attention to detail . 
POSITIVE:1 the riveting performances by the incredibly flexible cast make love a joy to behold . 
NEGATIVE:0 while american adobo has its heart ( and its palate ) in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
NEGATIVE:0 these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining . 
NEGATIVE:0 the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it's extremely well played and often very funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge . 
POSITIVE:1 a very charming and funny movie . 
POSITIVE:1 scott delivers a terrific performance in this fascinating portrait of a modern lothario . 
POSITIVE:1 sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film . 
POSITIVE:1 it's clear that mehta simply wanted to update her beloved genre for the thousands of indians who fancy themselves too sophisticated for the cheese-laced spectacles that pack 'em in on the subcontinent . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class . 
POSITIVE:1 boisterous , heartfelt comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
POSITIVE:1 maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 pap invested in undergraduate doubling subtexts and ridiculous stabs at existentialism reminding of the discovery of the wizard of god in the fifth trek flick . 
POSITIVE:1 ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum . 
POSITIVE:1 would make an excellent companion piece to the similarly themed 'the french lieutenant's woman . '
NEGATIVE:0 perhaps even the slc high command found writer-director mitch davis's wall of kitsch hard going . 
POSITIVE:1 road to perdition does display greatness , and it's worth seeing . but it also comes with the laziness and arrogance of a thing that already knows it's won . 
NEGATIVE:0 in gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . an otherwise intense , twist-and-turn thriller that certainly shouldn't hurt talented young gaghan's resume . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work . 
POSITIVE:1 every dance becomes about seduction , where backstabbing and betrayals are celebrated , and sex is currency . 
NEGATIVE:0 for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . 
NEGATIVE:0 the notion of deleting emotion from people , even in an advanced prozac nation , is so insanely dysfunctional that the rampantly designed equilibrium becomes a concept doofus . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's as if you're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . 
NEGATIVE:0 peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight . 
NEGATIVE:0 [siegel] and co-writers lisa bazadona and grace woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround frankie . 
POSITIVE:1 sayles has a knack for casting , often resurrecting performers who rarely work in movies now . . . and drawing flavorful performances from bland actors . 
NEGATIVE:0 if the full monty was a freshman fluke , lucky break is [cattaneo] sophomore slump . 
POSITIVE:1 an overly melodramatic but somewhat insightful french coming-of-age film . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 stale , futile scenario . 
POSITIVE:1 highly engaging . 
NEGATIVE:0 indifferently implausible popcorn programmer of a movie . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
NEGATIVE:0 [creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . 
NEGATIVE:0 my own minority report is that it stinks . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . is funny in the way that makes you ache with sadness ( the way chekhov is funny ) , profound without ever being self-important , warm without ever succumbing to sentimentality . 
NEGATIVE:0 shallow , noisy and pretentious . 
NEGATIVE:0 the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full-blown movie . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's greatest asset is how much it's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture . 
POSITIVE:1 the early and middle passages are surprising in how much they engage and even touch us . this is not a classical dramatic animated feature , nor a hip , contemporary , in-jokey one . it's sort of in-between , and it works . 
POSITIVE:1 a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world of children's television . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're down for a silly hack-and-slash flick , you can do no wrong with jason x . 
POSITIVE:1 there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
NEGATIVE:0 call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
NEGATIVE:0 wishy-washy . 
POSITIVE:1 excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama . 
POSITIVE:1 an estrogen opera so intensely feminine that it serves as the antidote ( and cannier doppelganger ) to diesel's xxx flex-a-thon . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film neither bitter nor sweet , neither romantic nor comedic , neither warm nor fuzzy . 
NEGATIVE:0 bad company has one of the most moronic screenplays of the year , full of holes that will be obvious even to those who aren't looking for them . 
NEGATIVE:0 trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible . 
NEGATIVE:0 about one in three gags in white's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook . 
NEGATIVE:0 but buying into sham truths and routine " indie " filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre . 
NEGATIVE:0 unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . 
POSITIVE:1 even though we know the outcome , the seesawing of the general's fate in the arguments of competing lawyers has the stomach-knotting suspense of a legal thriller , while the testimony of witnesses lends the film a resonant undertone of tragedy . 
POSITIVE:1 most haunting about " fence " is its conclusion , when we hear the ultimate fate of these girls and realize , much to our dismay , that this really did happen . noyce's greatest mistake is thinking that we needed sweeping , dramatic , hollywood moments to keep us
POSITIVE:1 leaping from one arresting image to another , songs from the second floor has all the enjoyable randomness of a very lively dream and so manages to be compelling , amusing and unsettling at the same time . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro . 
NEGATIVE:0 eventually , they will have a showdown , but , by then , your senses are as mushy as peas and you don't care who fires the winning shot . 
POSITIVE:1 apuestas fuertes para el futuro del director , y apuestas bien fundadas , pues la suerte ya la tiene , y la cinta lo comprueba . . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole talking-animal thing is grisly . 
POSITIVE:1 the most amazing super-sized dosage of goofball stunts any " jackass " fan could want . 
NEGATIVE:0 a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
NEGATIVE:0 i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dumb movie with dumb characters doing dumb things and you have to be really dumb not to see where this is going . 
NEGATIVE:0 entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . 
POSITIVE:1 as animation increasingly emphasizes the computer and the cool , this is a film that takes a stand in favor of tradition and warmth . 
NEGATIVE:0 full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , kung pow ! is the kind of movie that's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low . 
POSITIVE:1 a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive's attention to detail . 
POSITIVE:1 by the standards of knucklehead swill , the hot chick is pretty damned funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter . 
NEGATIVE:0 disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies…or any other john woo flick for that matter . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape . 
NEGATIVE:0 this hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on hopkins' inclination to play hannibal lecter again , even though harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
POSITIVE:1 noyce's film is contemplative and mournfully reflective . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment . 
POSITIVE:1 [reno] delivers a monologue that manages to incorporate both the horror and the absurdity of the situation in a well-balanced fashion . 
POSITIVE:1 i'm not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a smart , funny look at an arcane area of popular culture , and if it isn't entirely persuasive , it does give exposure to some talented performers . 
NEGATIVE:0 distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register . 
POSITIVE:1 more mature than fatal attraction , more complete than indecent proposal and more relevant than 9 ½ weeks , unfaithful is at once intimate and universal cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 the so-inept- it's-surreal dubbing ( featuring the voices of glenn close , regis philbin and breckin meyer ) brings back memories of cheesy old godzilla flicks . 
NEGATIVE:0 i kept wishing i was watching a documentary about the wartime navajos and what they accomplished instead of all this specious hollywood hoo-ha . 
POSITIVE:1 hey , who else needs a shower ? 
POSITIVE:1 saddled with an unwieldy cast of characters and angles , but the payoff is powerful and revelatory . 
NEGATIVE:0 bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
NEGATIVE:0 has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . 
NEGATIVE:0 watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . 
POSITIVE:1 a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness . 
POSITIVE:1 deep intelligence and a warm , enveloping affection breathe out of every frame . 
NEGATIVE:0 your appreciation of it will depend on what experiences you bring to it and what associations you choose to make . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you've seen " stomp " ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this ! 
NEGATIVE:0 an unpredictable blend of gal-pal smart talk , romantic comedy and dark tragedy that bites off considerably more than writer/director john mckay can swallow . 
POSITIVE:1 twohy's a good yarn-spinner , and ultimately the story compels . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's needlessly opaque intro takes its doe-eyed crudup out of pre-9/11 new york and onto a cross-country road trip of the homeric kind . 
POSITIVE:1 sorvino is delightful in the central role . she nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit . 
POSITIVE:1 not too far below the gloss you can still feel director denis villeneuve's beating heart and the fondness he has for his characters . 
POSITIVE:1 if you're a fan of the series you'll love it and probably want to see it twice . i will be . 
NEGATIVE:0 intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is a negligible work of manipulation , an exploitation piece doing its usual worst to guilt-trip parents . 
POSITIVE:1 an unflinching , complex portrait of a modern israel that is rarely seen on-screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
POSITIVE:1 that death is merely a transition is a common tenet in the world's religions . this deeply spiritual film taps into the meaning and consolation in afterlife communications . 
POSITIVE:1 neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . 
POSITIVE:1 exciting documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 it provides an honest look at a community striving to anchor itself in new grounds . 
POSITIVE:1 special p . o . v . camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense imax screen . 
POSITIVE:1 fast-paced and wonderfully edited , the film is extremely thorough . 
NEGATIVE:0 with minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub . 
POSITIVE:1 it treats ana's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . 
POSITIVE:1 texan director george ratliff had unlimited access to families and church meetings , and he delivers fascinating psychological fare . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing i can say is that i can't remember a single name responsible for it . 
NEGATIVE:0 ritchie's film is easier to swallow than wertmuller's polemical allegory , but it's self-defeatingly decorous . 
POSITIVE:1 a biopic about crane's life in the classic tradition but evolves into what has become of us all in the era of video . 
NEGATIVE:0 too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
NEGATIVE:0 teen movies have really hit the skids . 
POSITIVE:1 gangster no . 1 is solid , satisfying fare for adults . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects . 
POSITIVE:1 doesn't do more than expand a tv show to movie length . however , it's pleasant enough and its ecological , pro-wildlife sentiments are certainly welcome . 
POSITIVE:1 beautifully observed , miraculously unsentimental comedy-drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
NEGATIVE:0  " collateral damage " goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment – until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief
POSITIVE:1 we get an image of big papa spanning history , rather than suspending it . 
NEGATIVE:0 plays like john le carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders . 
NEGATIVE:0 clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . 
POSITIVE:1 craig bartlett and director tuck tucker should be commended for illustrating the merits of fighting hard for something that really matters . 
NEGATIVE:0 [director] o'fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short . 
NEGATIVE:0 those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
NEGATIVE:0 all movie long , city by the sea swings from one approach to the other , but in the end , it stays in formula -- which is a waste of de niro , mcdormand and the other good actors in the cast . 
POSITIVE:1 with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams , the spy kids franchise establishes itself as a durable part of the movie landscape : a james bond series for kids . 
POSITIVE:1 who needs mind-bending drugs when they can see this , the final part of the 'qatsi' trilogy , directed by godfrey reggio , with music by philip glass ? 
NEGATIVE:0 dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
NEGATIVE:0 nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises . 
POSITIVE:1 a compelling spanish film about the withering effects of jealousy in the life of a young monarch whose sexual passion for her husband becomes an obsession . 
POSITIVE:1 you will emerge with a clearer view of how the gears of justice grind on and the death report comes to share airtime alongside the farm report . 
NEGATIVE:0 it treats women like idiots . 
NEGATIVE:0 ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . 
POSITIVE:1 young hanks and fisk , who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents , bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work . 
POSITIVE:1 after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here , it's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen . 
NEGATIVE:0 a subtle variation on i spit on your grave in which our purported heroine pathologically avenges a hatred for men . 
POSITIVE:1 denis forges out of the theories of class- based rage and sisterly obsession a razor-sided tuning fork that rings with cultural , sexual and social discord . 
NEGATIVE:0 it never rises to its clever what-if concept . 
NEGATIVE:0 the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory . 
POSITIVE:1 the wild thornberrys movie has all the sibling rivalry and general family chaos to which anyone can relate . 
POSITIVE:1 a moving and stark reminder that the casualties of war reach much further than we imagine . 
POSITIVE:1 francophiles will snicker knowingly and you'll want to slap them . 
POSITIVE:1 the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff . 
NEGATIVE:0 the makers of mothman prophecies succeed in producing that most frightening of all movies -- a mediocre horror film too bad to be good and too good to be bad . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a humble effort , but spiced with wry humor and genuine pathos , especially between morgan and redgrave . 
NEGATIVE:0 a manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse . 
NEGATIVE:0 the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
NEGATIVE:0 shallow . 
NEGATIVE:0 with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
POSITIVE:1 a respectable venture on its own terms , lacking the broader vision that has seen certain trek films . . . cross over to a more mainstream audience . 
POSITIVE:1 a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied . 
NEGATIVE:0 no amount of good acting is enough to save oleander's uninspired story . 
POSITIVE:1 it's [ricci's] best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world's misery with blind good will . 
POSITIVE:1 the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the year's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . 
POSITIVE:1 with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintarô's metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own . 
POSITIVE:1 boasts a handful of virtuosic set pieces and offers a fair amount of trashy , kinky fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 in the end , the weight of water comes to resemble the kind of soft-core twaddle you'd expect to see on showtime's 'red shoe diaries . '
POSITIVE:1 huppert's show to steal and she makes a meal of it , channeling kathy baker's creepy turn as the repressed mother on boston public just as much as 8 women's augustine . 
POSITIVE:1 a drama of great power , yet some members of the audience will leave the theater believing they have seen a comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film's tart , sugar-free wit . 
POSITIVE:1 in all fairness , i must report that the children of varying ages in my audience never coughed , fidgeted or romped up and down the aisles for bathroom breaks . 
POSITIVE:1 it has a way of seeping into your consciousness , with lingering questions about what the film is really getting at . 
NEGATIVE:0 'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
POSITIVE:1 an original gem about an obsession with time . 
POSITIVE:1 narc is a no-bull throwback to 1970s action films . it zips along with b-movie verve while adding the rich details and go-for-broke acting that heralds something special . 
NEGATIVE:0 yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
NEGATIVE:0 when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w . 
POSITIVE:1 i don't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh's full frontal , though that didn't stop me from enjoying much of it . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . best seen as speculative history , as much an exploration of the paranoid impulse as a creative sequel to the warren report . 
NEGATIVE:0 i hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of high art . 
POSITIVE:1 the transporter is as lively and as fun as it is unapologetically dumb
NEGATIVE:0 the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it isn't exactly kiddie-friendly… alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown . 
POSITIVE:1 while broomfield's film doesn't capture the effect of these tragic deaths on hip-hop culture , it succeeds as a powerful look at a failure of our justice system . 
NEGATIVE:0 it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . 
POSITIVE:1 if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
POSITIVE:1 rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic . 
NEGATIVE:0 with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
POSITIVE:1 the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear . 
NEGATIVE:0 a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
POSITIVE:1 exhilarating but blatantly biased . 
POSITIVE:1 comedian , like its subjects , delivers the goods and audiences will have a fun , no-frills ride . 
POSITIVE:1 the story ultimately takes hold and grips hard . 
POSITIVE:1 like mike doesn't win any points for originality . it does succeed by following a feel-good formula with a winning style , and by offering its target audience of urban kids some welcome role models and optimism . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the film's most effective aspects is its tchaikovsky soundtrack of neurasthenic regret . 
NEGATIVE:0 what is 100% missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . 
POSITIVE:1 spider-man is about growing strange hairs , getting a more mature body , and finding it necessary to hide new secretions from the parental units . 
NEGATIVE:0 this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states . 
POSITIVE:1 forgettable horror -- more gory than psychological -- with a highly satisfying quotient of friday-night excitement and milla power . 
NEGATIVE:0 the result is an 'action film' mired in stasis . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a magnificent drama well worth tracking down . 
POSITIVE:1 although occasionally static to the point of resembling a stage play , the film delivers a solid mixture of sweetness and laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0 one groan-inducing familiarity begets another . 
NEGATIVE:0 the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . 
NEGATIVE:0 everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
POSITIVE:1 secretary " is owned by its costars , spader and gyllenhaal . maggie g . makes an amazing breakthrough in her first starring role and eats up the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course . 
NEGATIVE:0 this isn't even madonna's swept away . this is her blue lagoon . 
NEGATIVE:0 a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters . 
POSITIVE:1 as blunt as it is in depicting child abuse , el bola is a movie steeped in an ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance . 
POSITIVE:1 sure , it's contrived and predictable , but its performances are so well tuned that the film comes off winningly , even though it's never as solid as you want it to be . 
NEGATIVE:0 well-meaning but inert . 
POSITIVE:1 neatly constructed thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0 message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film . 
NEGATIVE:0 gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing . 
POSITIVE:1 here's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . but taken as a stylish and energetic one-shot , the queen of the damned cannot be said to suck . 
POSITIVE:1 this masterfully calibrated psychological thriller thrives on its taut performances and creepy atmosphere even if the screenplay falls somewhat short . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a bad sign in a thriller when you instantly know whodunit . 
POSITIVE:1 ultimately , " mib ii " succeeds due to its rapid-fire delivery and enough inspired levity that it can't be dismissed as mindless . 
POSITIVE:1 one feels the dimming of a certain ambition , but in its place a sweetness , clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early italian neorealism . 
NEGATIVE:0 one of the more irritating cartoons you will see this , or any , year . 
POSITIVE:1 legendary irish writer brendan behan's memoir , borstal boy , has been given a loving screen transferral . 
POSITIVE:1 director charles stone iii applies more detail to the film's music than to the story line ; what's best about drumline is its energy . 
POSITIVE:1 psychologically revealing . 
POSITIVE:1 enticing and often funny documentary . 
POSITIVE:1 i have always appreciated a smartly written motion picture , and , whatever flaws igby goes down may possess , it is undeniably that . 
POSITIVE:1 chaiken ably balances real-time rhythms with propulsive incident . 
POSITIVE:1 de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff . 
NEGATIVE:0 for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . 
POSITIVE:1 a savvy exploration of paranoia and insecurity in america's culture of fear . 
NEGATIVE:0 don't let your festive spirit go this far . 
POSITIVE:1 bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that doesn't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it . 
NEGATIVE:0 as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely . 
POSITIVE:1 [d]oesn't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful . 
NEGATIVE:0 has nothing good to speak about other than the fact that it is relatively short , tries its best to hide the fact that seagal's overweight and out of shape . 
NEGATIVE:0 fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation . . . well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care . 
NEGATIVE:0 i wonder what the reaction of israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation . 
POSITIVE:1 is truth stranger than fiction ? in [screenwriter] charlie kaufman's world , truth and fiction are equally strange , and his for the taking . 
NEGATIVE:0  " freaky friday , " it's not . 
POSITIVE:1 well-acted , well-directed and , for all its moodiness , not too pretentious . 
POSITIVE:1 ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
NEGATIVE:0 thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents
NEGATIVE:0 offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . 
NEGATIVE:0 i guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
POSITIVE:1 for every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie's conception of a future-world holographic librarian ( orlando jones ) who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized . 
NEGATIVE:0 you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
POSITIVE:1 it's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a feel-good movie about which you can actually feel good . 
POSITIVE:1 this one is not nearly as dreadful as expected . in fact , it's quite fun in places . 
POSITIVE:1 transforms one of [shakespeare's] deepest tragedies into a smart new comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 there has always been something likable about the marquis de sade . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film starts promisingly , but the ending is all too predictable and far too cliched to really work . 
POSITIVE:1 even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all . 
POSITIVE:1 it excels because , unlike so many other hollywood movies of its ilk , it offers hope . 
POSITIVE:1 vibrantly colored and beautifully designed , metropolis is a feast for the eyes . 
POSITIVE:1 a sensitive and astute first feature by anne-sophie birot . 
NEGATIVE:0 anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time . 
NEGATIVE:0 a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . 
NEGATIVE:0 what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart , provocative drama that does the nearly impossible : it gets under the skin of a man we only know as an evil , monstrous lunatic . 
NEGATIVE:0 a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
POSITIVE:1 not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j . k . rowling's books . 
NEGATIVE:0 technically and artistically inept . 
NEGATIVE:0 disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
NEGATIVE:0 i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations . it's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's not enough to sustain the comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 the bodily function jokes are about what you'd expect , but there are rich veins of funny stuff in this movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a surprisingly funny movie . 
POSITIVE:1 a rip-roaring comedy action fest that'll put hairs on your chest . 
POSITIVE:1 mastering its formidable arithmetic of cameras and souls , group articulates a flood of emotion . 
NEGATIVE:0 true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
NEGATIVE:0 the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
NEGATIVE:0 the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . 
NEGATIVE:0 less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is . 
POSITIVE:1 an engrossing iranian film about two itinerant teachers and some lost and desolate people they encounter in a place where war has savaged the lives and liberties of the poor and the dispossessed . 
POSITIVE:1 a tour de force drama about the astonishingly pivotal role of imagination in the soulful development of two rowdy teenagers . 
POSITIVE:1 one of recent memory's most thoughtful films about art , ethics , and the cost of moral compromise . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b . s . one another and put on a show in drag . 
NEGATIVE:0 much like robin williams , death to smoochy has already reached its expiration date . 
POSITIVE:1 a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out
POSITIVE:1 though it's become almost redundant to say so , major kudos go to leigh for actually casting people who look working-class . 
POSITIVE:1 an impressive hybrid . 
NEGATIVE:0 the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached . 
NEGATIVE:0 a non-mystery mystery . 
POSITIVE:1 a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe . . . the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history . 
NEGATIVE:0 none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
NEGATIVE:0 swinging , the film makes it seem , is not a hobby that attracts the young and fit . or intelligent . 
NEGATIVE:0 schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . 
NEGATIVE:0 take away the controversy , and it's not much more watchable than a mexican soap opera . 
NEGATIVE:0 its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary . 
NEGATIVE:0 completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
POSITIVE:1 to the film's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment . 
NEGATIVE:0 humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention . 
NEGATIVE:0 on top of a foundering performance , [madonna's] denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag . 
POSITIVE:1 the film has several strong performances . 
POSITIVE:1 executed with such gentle but insistent sincerity , with such good humor and appreciation of the daily grind that only the most hardhearted scrooge could fail to respond . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is so bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction . 
POSITIVE:1 even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it's documenting . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
POSITIVE:1 a jewish ww ii doc that isn't trying simply to out-shock , out-outrage or out-depress its potential audience ! who knew . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another . 
POSITIVE:1 steven soderbergh's digital video experiment is a clever and cutting , quick and dirty look at modern living and movie life . 
POSITIVE:1 it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
POSITIVE:1 a bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing . 
POSITIVE:1 lavishly , exhilaratingly tasteless . 
POSITIVE:1 the members manage to pronounce kok exactly as you think they might , thus giving the cast ample opportunity to use that term as often as possible . it's very beavis and butthead , yet always seems to elicit a chuckle . 
NEGATIVE:0 a vile , incoherent mess . . . a scummy ripoff of david cronenberg's brilliant 'videodrome . '
POSITIVE:1 there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way . 
NEGATIVE:0 deliberately and devotedly constructed , far from heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
NEGATIVE:0 what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] soulless , stupid sequel . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
POSITIVE:1 the music makes a nice album , the food is enticing and italy beckons us all . 
POSITIVE:1 i am not generally a huge fan of cartoons derived from tv shows , but hey arnold ! the movie is clever , offbeat and even gritty enough to overcome my resistance . 
NEGATIVE:0 disjointed parody . 
POSITIVE:1 the auteur's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug . 
POSITIVE:1 this is human comedy at its most amusing , interesting and confirming . 
POSITIVE:1 the storytelling may be ordinary , but the cast is one of those all-star reunions that fans of gosford park have come to assume is just another day of brit cinema . 
NEGATIVE:0 aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
POSITIVE:1 director chris wedge and screenwriters michael berg , michael j . wilson and peter ackerman create some episodes that rival vintage looney tunes for the most creative mayhem in a brief amount of time . 
NEGATIVE:0 a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
POSITIVE:1 the cast is top-notch and i predict there will be plenty of female audience members drooling over michael idemoto as michael . 
NEGATIVE:0 with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . 
POSITIVE:1 for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale . 
POSITIVE:1 a french film with a more down-home flavor . 
NEGATIVE:0 [seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
NEGATIVE:0 [stevens is] so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits . 
POSITIVE:1 while not all transitions to adulthood are so fraught , there's much truth and no small amount of poetry in girls can't swim . 
NEGATIVE:0 i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
POSITIVE:1 with an expressive face reminiscent of gong li and a vivid personality like zhang ziyi's , dong stakes out the emotional heart of happy . 
NEGATIVE:0 amazingly dopey . 
POSITIVE:1  " it's all about the image . " 
POSITIVE:1 it's sweet . it's funny . it wears its heart on the sleeve of its gaudy hawaiian shirt . and , thanks to the presence of 'the king , ' it also rocks . 
POSITIVE:1 the picture runs a mere 84 minutes , but it's no glance . it's a head-turner -- thoughtfully written , beautifully read and , finally , deeply humanizing . 
POSITIVE:1 as gory as the scenes of torture and self-mutilation may be , they are pitted against shimmering cinematography that lends the setting the ethereal beauty of an asian landscape painting . 
POSITIVE:1 director douglas mcgrath takes on nickleby with all the halfhearted zeal of an 8th grade boy delving into required reading . 
NEGATIVE:0 except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . 
NEGATIVE:0 a porn film without the sex scenes . 
POSITIVE:1 as directed by dani kouyate of burkina faso , sia lacks visual flair . but kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them . 
NEGATIVE:0 it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
NEGATIVE:0  sandra bullock and hugh grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students . 
POSITIVE:1 a fiercely clever and subtle film , capturing the precarious balance between the extravagant confidence of the exiled aristocracy and the cruel earnestness of the victorious revolutionaries . 
NEGATIVE:0 aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music . 
POSITIVE:1 people cinema at its finest . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
POSITIVE:1 one thing you have to give them credit for : the message of the movie is consistent with the messages espoused in the company's previous video work . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead . 
POSITIVE:1 where bowling for columbine is at its most valuable is in its examination of america's culture of fear as a root cause of gun violence . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film that loses sight of its own story . 
POSITIVE:1 unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile . 
NEGATIVE:0 watching " ending " is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor's garage sale . you can't believe anyone would really buy this stuff . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's surely something wrong with a comedy where the only belly laughs come from the selection of outtakes tacked onto the end credits . 
POSITIVE:1 a conventional , but well-crafted film about a historic legal battle in ireland over a man's right to raise his own children . 
NEGATIVE:0 a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience . 
POSITIVE:1 the kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself . 
POSITIVE:1 what lee does so marvelously compelling is present brown as a catalyst for the struggle of black manhood in restrictive and chaotic america . . . sketchy but nevertheless gripping portrait of jim brown , a celebrated wonder in the spotlight
NEGATIVE:0 an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
POSITIVE:1 the script's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off . 
POSITIVE:1 flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with . 
POSITIVE:1 the vitality of the actors keeps the intensity of the film high , even as the strafings blend together . 
NEGATIVE:0 with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
NEGATIVE:0 the concept is a hoot . the trailer is a riot . the movie is a dud . 
NEGATIVE:0 in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
POSITIVE:1 roman polanski's autobiographical gesture at redemption is better than 'shindler's list' - it is more than merely a holocaust movie . 
POSITIVE:1 if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos . 
NEGATIVE:0 the armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment . 
POSITIVE:1 bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted- from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie of riveting power and sadness . 
POSITIVE:1 a fine production with splendid singing by angela gheorghiu , ruggero raimondi , and roberto alagna . 
POSITIVE:1 the film feels uncomfortably real , its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority . 
POSITIVE:1 an escapist confection that's pure entertainment . 
POSITIVE:1 a beautifully tooled action thriller about love and terrorism in korea . 
POSITIVE:1 belongs to daniel day-lewis as much as it belongs to martin scorsese ; it's a memorable performance in a big , brassy , disturbing , unusual and highly successful film . 
POSITIVE:1 as literary desecrations go , this makes for perfectly acceptable , occasionally very enjoyable children's entertainment . you'll forget about it by monday , though , and if they're old enough to have developed some taste , so will your kids . 
POSITIVE:1 the acting , for the most part , is terrific , although the actors must struggle with the fact that they're playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh-and-blood humans . 
NEGATIVE:0 reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the cute frissons of discovery and humor between chaplin and kidman that keep this nicely wound clock not just ticking , but humming . 
POSITIVE:1 as averse as i usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream hollywood fantasies , this one got to me . 
POSITIVE:1 the result is mesmerizing -- filled with menace and squalor . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a story we haven't seen on the big screen before , and it's a story that we as americans , and human beings , should know . 
POSITIVE:1 presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it . 
NEGATIVE:0 johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . 
NEGATIVE:0 some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 after collateral damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned . but no . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to accomplish what few sequels can -- it equals the original and in some ways even betters it . 
NEGATIVE:0 all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
NEGATIVE:0 stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet . 
NEGATIVE:0 visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's an awfully derivative story . 
NEGATIVE:0 ihops don't pile on this much syrup . 
POSITIVE:1 a damn fine and a truly distinctive and a deeply pertinent film . 
POSITIVE:1 the strength of the film lies in its two central performances by sven wollter as the stricken composer and viveka seldahl as his desperate violinist wife . 
NEGATIVE:0 a seriously bad film with seriously warped logic by writer-director kurt wimmer at the screenplay level . 
NEGATIVE:0 has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
NEGATIVE:0 this isn't a terrible film by any means , but it's also far from being a realized work . 
NEGATIVE:0 a working class " us vs . them " opera that leaves no heartstring untugged and no liberal cause unplundered . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . strips bible stores of the potential for sanctimoniousness , making them meaningful for both kids and church-wary adults . 
NEGATIVE:0 less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
NEGATIVE:0 a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy's well-honed prima donna shtick . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships . 
NEGATIVE:0 what might have been acceptable on the printed page of iles' book does not translate well to the screen . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept . 
POSITIVE:1 hawn and sarandon form an acting bond that makes the banger sisters a fascinating character study with laughs to spare . 
POSITIVE:1 passion , melodrama , sorrow , laugther , and tears cascade over the screen effortlessly . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects . 
NEGATIVE:0 an awkwardly garish showcase that diverges from anything remotely probing or penetrating . 
POSITIVE:1 anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film . 
POSITIVE:1 bouquet gives a performance that is masterly . 
NEGATIVE:0 even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles . . . so it's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that's ultimately rather inconsequential . 
NEGATIVE:0 supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
POSITIVE:1 captures the raw comic energy of one of our most flamboyant female comics . 
NEGATIVE:0 reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish . 
POSITIVE:1 a little better than sorcerer's stone . 
POSITIVE:1 frei assembles a fascinating profile of a deeply humanistic artist who , in spite of all that he's witnessed , remains surprisingly idealistic , and retains an extraordinary faith in the ability of images to communicate the truth of the world around him . 
NEGATIVE:0 never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days . 
NEGATIVE:0 the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor — but it's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake- of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity . 
POSITIVE:1 a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert . 
POSITIVE:1 a movie for 11-year-old boys with sports dreams of their own and the preteen girls who worship lil' bow wow . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script is a tired one , with few moments of joy rising above the stale material . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is predictable in the reassuring manner of a beautifully sung holiday carol . 
NEGATIVE:0 earnest falls short of its ideal predecessor largely due to parker's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material . 
NEGATIVE:0 on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it . 
POSITIVE:1 like the best 60 minutes exposé , the film ( at 80 minutes ) is actually quite entertaining . 
POSITIVE:1 a riveting story well told . 
NEGATIVE:0 i saw knockaround guys yesterday , and already the details have faded like photographs from the spanish-american war . . . it's so unmemorable that it turned my ballpoint notes to invisible ink . 
POSITIVE:1 the banter between calvin and his fellow barbers feels like a streetwise mclaughlin group . . . and never fails to entertain . 
NEGATIVE:0 it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
NEGATIVE:0 schaefer's . . . determination to inject farcical raunch . . . drowns out the promise of the romantic angle . 
POSITIVE:1 for anyone unfamiliar with pentacostal practices in general and theatrical phenomenon of hell houses in particular , it's an eye-opener . 
NEGATIVE:0  it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from france . 
POSITIVE:1 shainberg weaves a carefully balanced scenario that is controlled by neither character , is weirdly sympathetic to both and manages to be tender and darkly comic . 
NEGATIVE:0 eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . 
NEGATIVE:0 [two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . 
NEGATIVE:0 better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's another video movie photographed like a film , with the bad lighting that's often written off as indie film naturalism . 
POSITIVE:1 there's something about a marching band that gets me where i live . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a demented kitsch mess ( although the smeary digital video does match the muddled narrative ) , but it's savvy about celebrity and has more guts and energy than much of what will open this year . 
NEGATIVE:0 don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
NEGATIVE:0  " bad " is the operative word for " bad company , " and i don't mean that in a good way . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
NEGATIVE:0 they should have called it gutterball . 
POSITIVE:1 although the level of the comedy declines as the movie proceeds , there's no denying the fun of watching de niro and crystal having fun . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
POSITIVE:1 leigh's daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher's ruinous legacy , he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other . 
POSITIVE:1 bring on the sequel . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the year's best films , featuring an oscar-worthy performance by julianne moore . 
POSITIVE:1 a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . 
NEGATIVE:0 the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
NEGATIVE:0 the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor . 
POSITIVE:1 for those who are intrigued by politics of the '70s , the film is every bit as fascinating as it is flawed . 
NEGATIVE:0 so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject . 
POSITIVE:1 a dark , quirky road movie that constantly defies expectation . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a reason why halftime is only fifteen minutes long . 
POSITIVE:1 guaranteed to move anyone who ever shook , rattled , or rolled . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests . 
NEGATIVE:0 culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
POSITIVE:1 the story line may be 127 years old , but el crimen del padre amaro . . . couldn't be more timely in its despairing vision of corruption within the catholic establishment . 
NEGATIVE:0 the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
POSITIVE:1 wang xiaoshuai directs this intricately structured and well-realized drama that presents a fascinating glimpse of urban life and the class warfare that embroils two young men . 
NEGATIVE:0 unfortunately , kapur modernizes a . e . w . mason's story to suit the sensibilities of a young american , a decision that plucks " the four feathers " bare . 
POSITIVE:1 for those who like quirky , slightly strange french films , this is a must ! 
NEGATIVE:0 boasts eye-catching art direction but has a forcefully quirky tone that quickly wears out its limited welcome . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original new testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . unlike [scorsese's mean streets] , ash wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot . 
POSITIVE:1 a slam-bang extravaganza that is all about a wild-and-woolly , wall-to-wall good time . 
NEGATIVE:0 when the film ended , i felt tired and drained and wanted to lie on my own deathbed for a while . 
NEGATIVE:0 it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
NEGATIVE:0 kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
POSITIVE:1 prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment . 
NEGATIVE:0 mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness . 
NEGATIVE:0 a peculiar misfire that even tunney can't save . 
NEGATIVE:0 what ultimately makes windtalkers a disappointment is the superficial way it deals with its story . 
POSITIVE:1 michael moore's latest documentary about america's thirst for violence is his best film yet . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 pretend it's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away . it's fun , but it's a real howler . 
NEGATIVE:0 wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
POSITIVE:1 has the rare capability to soothe and break your heart with a single stroke . 
POSITIVE:1 the film doesn't sustain its initial promise with a jarring , new-agey tone creeping into the second half
POSITIVE:1 the film is bright and flashy in all the right ways . 
NEGATIVE:0 each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . 
POSITIVE:1 i am more offended by his lack of faith in his audience than by anything on display here . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is very little dread or apprehension , and though i like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill . 
POSITIVE:1 a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind . 
POSITIVE:1 the picture's fascinating byways are littered with trenchant satirical jabs at the peculiar egocentricities of the acting breed . 
POSITIVE:1 the fly-on-the-wall method used to document rural french school life is a refreshing departure from the now more prevalent technique of the docu-makers being a visible part of their work . 
NEGATIVE:0 snipes is both a snore and utter tripe . 
POSITIVE:1 nothing short of a masterpiece -- and a challenging one . 
POSITIVE:1 escapes the precious trappings of most romantic comedies , infusing into the story very real , complicated emotions . 
NEGATIVE:0 in exactly 89 minutes , most of which passed as slowly as if i'd been sitting naked on an igloo , formula 51 sank from quirky to jerky to utter turkey . 
POSITIVE:1 affirms the gifts of all involved , starting with spielberg and going right through the ranks of the players -- on-camera and off -- that he brings together . 
NEGATIVE:0 waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot oscar season currently underway . 
NEGATIVE:0 a derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches . 
POSITIVE:1 a family film that contains some hefty thematic material on time , death , eternity , and what is needed to live a rich and full life . 
POSITIVE:1 farrell . . . thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis's world-weary colonel . 
POSITIVE:1 an artful , intelligent film that stays within the confines of a well-established genre . 
POSITIVE:1 although the editing might have been tighter , hush ! sympathetically captures the often futile lifestyle of young people in modern japan . 
NEGATIVE:0 new ways of describing badness need to be invented to describe exactly how bad it is . 
NEGATIVE:0 two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than evelyn this year . 
NEGATIVE:0 what can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ? 
POSITIVE:1 daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget . 
NEGATIVE:0 god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse . 
POSITIVE:1 you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story . 
NEGATIVE:0 steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
NEGATIVE:0 parker probably thinks he's shaking up a classic the way kenneth branagh and baz luhrmann have , but this half-hearted messing-about just makes us miss wilde's still-contemporary play . 
POSITIVE:1 the mood , look and tone of the film fit the incredible storyline to a t . 
NEGATIVE:0 festers in just such a dungpile that you'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you . 
POSITIVE:1 robert harmon's less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film's thick shadows . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
NEGATIVE:0 a cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of [besson's] earlier work . 
NEGATIVE:0 for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
NEGATIVE:0 as tweedy talks about canning his stockbroker and repairing his pool , you yearn for a few airborne tv sets or nude groupies on the nod to liven things up . 
NEGATIVE:0 it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
POSITIVE:1 red dragon is less baroque and showy than hannibal , and less emotionally affecting than silence . but , like silence , it's a movie that gets under your skin . 
POSITIVE:1 diane lane works nothing short of a minor miracle in unfaithful . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured christmas season pics ever delivered by a hollywood studio . 
POSITIVE:1 like mike is a harmlessly naïve slice of b-ball fantasy , fit for filling in during the real nba's off-season . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite auteuil's performance , it's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug . 
NEGATIVE:0 all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's absolutely amazing how first-time director kevin donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of chan . make chan's action sequences boring . 
NEGATIVE:0 the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
NEGATIVE:0 what little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else . 
POSITIVE:1 a perverse little truffle , dainty psychological terror on the outside with a creamy filling of familial jealousy and unrepentant domestic psychopathy . 
POSITIVE:1 demonstrates a vivid imagination and an impressive style that result in some terrific setpieces . 
POSITIVE:1 a story about intelligent high school students that deals with first love sweetly but also seriously . it is also beautifully acted . 
NEGATIVE:0 irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . 
POSITIVE:1 filled with alexandre desplat's haunting and sublime music , the movie completely transfixes the audience . 
POSITIVE:1 the overall result is an intelligent , realistic portrayal of testing boundaries . 
POSITIVE:1 even if it pushes its agenda too forcefully , this remains a film about something , one that attempts and often achieves a level of connection and concern . 
NEGATIVE:0 hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud . 
NEGATIVE:0 the château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
POSITIVE:1 a glib but bouncy bit of sixties-style slickness in which the hero might wind up caught but the audience gets pure escapism . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] poorly executed comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 with an obvious rapport with her actors and a striking style behind the camera , hélène angel is definitely a director to watch . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short . 
POSITIVE:1 the saturation bombing of reggio's images and glass' evocative music . . . ultimately leaves viewers with the task of divining meaning . 
NEGATIVE:0 national lampoon's van wilder may aim to be the next animal house , but it more closely resembles this year's version of tomcats . 
NEGATIVE:0 when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . 
POSITIVE:1 bogdanovich taps deep into the hearst mystique , entertainingly reenacting a historic scandal . 
NEGATIVE:0 the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
POSITIVE:1 the filmmakers wisely decided to let crocodile hunter steve irwin do what he does best , and fashion a story around him . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg . 
POSITIVE:1 the inherent strength of the material as well as the integrity of the filmmakers gives this coming-of-age story restraint as well as warmth . 
POSITIVE:1 whether you're moved and love it , or bored or frustrated by the film , you'll still feel something . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's something unintentionally comic in the film's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties . 
POSITIVE:1 a very good film sits in the place where a masterpiece should be . 
NEGATIVE:0 at some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill . 
NEGATIVE:0 if oscar had a category called best bad film you thought was going to be really awful but wasn't , guys would probably be duking it out with the queen of the damned for the honor . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a technically superb film , shining with all the usual spielberg flair , expertly utilizing the talents of his top-notch creative team . 
POSITIVE:1 this may be burns's strongest film since the brothers mcmullen . 
POSITIVE:1 as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan . 
POSITIVE:1 preaches to two completely different choirs at the same time , which is a pretty amazing accomplishment . 
POSITIVE:1 recoing's fantastic performance doesn't exactly reveal what makes vincent tick , but perhaps any definitive explanation for it would have felt like a cheat . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today . 
POSITIVE:1 the film sparkles with the the wisdom and humor of its subjects . 
POSITIVE:1 a warm but realistic meditation on friendship , family and affection . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure , as long as you don't try to look too deep into the story
NEGATIVE:0 when [reno] lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at george w . bush , henry kissinger , larry king , et al . , reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture . 
POSITIVE:1 whether [binoche and magimel] are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny phonce and his several silly subplots . 
POSITIVE:1 two weeks notice has appeal beyond being a sandra bullock vehicle or a standard romantic comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
POSITIVE:1 [ " take care of my cat " ] is an honestly nice little film that takes us on an examination of young adult life in urban south korea through the hearts and minds of the five principals . 
NEGATIVE:0 it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie's thesis -- elegant technology for the masses -- is surprisingly refreshing . 
POSITIVE:1 a great cast and a wonderful but sometimes confusing flashback movie about growing up in a dysfunctional family . 
POSITIVE:1 what sets this romantic comedy apart from most hollywood romantic comedies is its low-key way of tackling what seems like done-to-death material . 
POSITIVE:1 engrossing and affecting , if ultimately not quite satisfying . 
POSITIVE:1 more than anything else , kissing jessica stein injects freshness and spirit into the romantic comedy genre , which has been held hostage by generic scripts that seek to remake sleepless in seattle again and again . 
POSITIVE:1 sparkling , often hilarious romantic jealousy comedy . . . attal looks so much like a young robert deniro that it seems the film should instead be called 'my husband is travis bickle' . 
POSITIVE:1 both flawed and delayed , martin scorcese's gangs of new york still emerges as his most vital work since goodfellas . 
POSITIVE:1 as antonia is assimilated into this newfangled community , the film settles in and becomes compulsively watchable in a guilty-pleasure , daytime-drama sort of fashion . 
POSITIVE:1 a sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss . 
NEGATIVE:0 the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . 
POSITIVE:1 me without you has a bracing truth that's refreshing after the phoniness of female-bonding pictures like divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood . 
POSITIVE:1 despite its flaws , crazy as hell marks an encouraging new direction for la salle . 
NEGATIVE:0 a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent . 
POSITIVE:1 an involving , inspirational drama that sometimes falls prey to its sob-story trappings . 
POSITIVE:1 using a stock plot , about a boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater . 
NEGATIVE:0 an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
NEGATIVE:0 even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . 
POSITIVE:1 those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations . . . are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel . 
POSITIVE:1 a naturally funny film , home movie makes you crave chris smith's next movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 as happily glib and vicious as its characters . 
POSITIVE:1 there is little question that this is a serious work by an important director who has something new to say about how , in the flip-flop of courtship , we often reel in when we should be playing out . 
NEGATIVE:0 in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
POSITIVE:1 white oleander may leave you rolling your eyes in the dark , but that doesn't mean you won't like looking at it . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the efforts of its star , kline , to lend some dignity to a dumb story are for naught . 
NEGATIVE:0 blue crush is as predictable as the tides . . . . the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies . 
NEGATIVE:0 elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this . 
NEGATIVE:0 while the film shuns the glamour or glitz that an american movie might demand , scherfig tosses us a romantic scenario that is just as simplistic as a hollywood production . 
POSITIVE:1 weird , vulgar comedy that's definitely an acquired taste . 
NEGATIVE:0 more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
POSITIVE:1 huppert and girardot give performances of exceptional honesty . 
NEGATIVE:0 taylor appears to have blown his entire budget on soundtrack rights and had nothing left over for jokes . 
NEGATIVE:0 by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is a masterpiece of nuance and characterization , marred only by an inexplicable , utterly distracting blunder at the very end . 
NEGATIVE:0 trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
POSITIVE:1 [woo's] most resonant film since the killer . 
POSITIVE:1 it provides the grand , intelligent entertainment of a superior cast playing smart people amid a compelling plot . 
POSITIVE:1 though a capable thriller , somewhere along the way k-19 jettisoned some crucial drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here . 
NEGATIVE:0 i'm just too bored to care . 
POSITIVE:1 red dragon makes one appreciate silence of the lambs . 
POSITIVE:1 lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
POSITIVE:1 on the surface a silly comedy , scotland , pa would be forgettable if it weren't such a clever adaptation of the bard's tragic play . 
NEGATIVE:0 no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go . 
NEGATIVE:0 to paraphrase a line from another dickens' novel , nicholas nickleby is too much like a fragment of an underdone potato . 
POSITIVE:1 generates an enormous feeling of empathy for its characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 the densest distillation of roberts' movies ever made . 
NEGATIVE:0 a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . 
POSITIVE:1 hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people . 
POSITIVE:1 filled with honest performances and exceptional detail , baran is a gentle film with dramatic punch , a haunting ode to humanity . 
POSITIVE:1 this beautifully animated epic is never dull . 
NEGATIVE:0 perhaps the most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime . 
POSITIVE:1 throws in enough clever and unexpected twists to make the formula feel fresh . 
NEGATIVE:0 calculated swill . 
NEGATIVE:0 a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones . 
NEGATIVE:0 it is not the first time that director sara sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them . 
POSITIVE:1 miller comes at film with bracing intelligence and a vision both painterly and literary . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a very tasteful rock and roll movie . you could put it on a coffee table anywhere . 
POSITIVE:1 essentially an exceptionally well-written , well-edited , well-directed , well-acted , bald rip-off of aliens . 
POSITIVE:1 marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . a rich and intelligent film that uses its pulpy core conceit to probe questions of attraction and interdependence and how the heart accomodates practical needs . it is an unstinting look at a collaboration between damaged people that may or may not qual
POSITIVE:1 both exuberantly romantic and serenely melancholy , what time is it there ? may prove to be [tsai's] masterpiece . 
NEGATIVE:0 what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
NEGATIVE:0 de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . the film will play equally well on both the standard and giant screens . 
POSITIVE:1 the fourth " pokemon " is a diverting--if predictable--adventure suitable for a matinee , with a message that cautions children about disturbing the world's delicate ecological balance . 
POSITIVE:1 it's the unsettling images of a war-ravaged land that prove more potent and riveting than the unlikely story of sarah and harrison . 
POSITIVE:1 a grittily beautiful film that looks , sounds , and feels more like an extended , open-ended poem than a traditionally structured story . 
POSITIVE:1  . . . the implication is kissinger may have decided that — when it comes to truncheoning — it's better to give than to receive . 
NEGATIVE:0 the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . 
NEGATIVE:0 a little too pat for its own good . 
POSITIVE:1 denis and co-writer michele petin's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing . lead provocatuers testud and parmentier give superlative performances
POSITIVE:1 with the prospect of films like kangaroo jack about to burst across america's winter movie screens it's a pleasure to have a film like the hours as an alternative . 
POSITIVE:1 nettelbeck . . . has a pleasing way with a metaphor . 
POSITIVE:1 the imax screen enhances the personal touch of manual animation . 
NEGATIVE:0 the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . hokey art house pretension . 
NEGATIVE:0 enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre . the performances are so overstated , the effect comes off as self-parody . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
NEGATIVE:0 jacquot's rendering of puccini's tale of devotion and double-cross is more than just a filmed opera . in his first stab at the form , jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically . 
NEGATIVE:0 has all the right elements but completely fails to gel together . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
NEGATIVE:0 guys say mean things and shoot a lot of bullets . some of the characters die and others don't , and the film pretends that those living have learned some sort of lesson , and , really , nobody in the viewing audience cares . 
POSITIVE:1 gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film . 
NEGATIVE:0 sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
POSITIVE:1 an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids . 
POSITIVE:1 here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably . 
POSITIVE:1 this is one of mr . chabrol's subtlest works , but also one of his most uncanny . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
POSITIVE:1 solondz creates some effective moments of discomfort for character and viewer alike . 
POSITIVE:1 kept aloft largely by a comically adept ensemble . 
POSITIVE:1 good performances and a realistic , non-exploitive approach make paid in full worth seeing . 
POSITIVE:1 a penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic . 
POSITIVE:1 an intriguing cinematic omnibus and round-robin that occasionally is more interesting in concept than in execution . 
NEGATIVE:0 each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception . 
POSITIVE:1 it's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world . 
NEGATIVE:0 a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors . 
NEGATIVE:0 the pool drowned me in boredom . 
NEGATIVE:0 death to smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly -as-nasty -as-it- thinks-it-is joke . over and over again . 
POSITIVE:1 a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy . 
POSITIVE:1 the director explores all three sides of his story with a sensitivity and an inquisitiveness reminiscent of truffaut . 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
NEGATIVE:0 william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . . 
POSITIVE:1 if you like blood , guts and crazy beasts stalking men with guns though . . . you will likely enjoy this monster . 
NEGATIVE:0 there is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down . and that should tell you everything you need to know about all the queen's men . 
POSITIVE:1 makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's neither as sappy as big daddy nor as anarchic as happy gilmore or the waterboy , but it has its moments . 
POSITIVE:1 that haynes can both maintain and dismantle the facades that his genre and his character construct is a wonderous accomplishment of veracity and narrative grace . 
NEGATIVE:0 five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before . 
NEGATIVE:0 as vulgar as it is banal . 
POSITIVE:1 meticulously uncovers a trail of outrageous force and craven concealment . 
NEGATIVE:0 more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
POSITIVE:1 the pianist is a fine valedictory work for polanski , made richer by his own experiences , making his other movies somehow richer in the bargain . 
NEGATIVE:0 the trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through . 
NEGATIVE:0 [it's] difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view . 
POSITIVE:1 exactly what its title implies : lusty , boisterous and utterly charming . 
NEGATIVE:0 if you're looking for comedy to be served up , better look elsewhere . 
NEGATIVE:0 we haven't seen such hilarity since say it isn't so ! 
POSITIVE:1 family portrait of need , neurosis and nervy negativity is a rare treat that shows the promise of digital filmmaking . 
NEGATIVE:0 michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
NEGATIVE:0 one long , numbing action sequence made up mostly of routine stuff yuen has given us before . 
POSITIVE:1 on the surface , it's a lovers-on-the-run crime flick , but it has a lot in common with piesiewicz's and kieslowski's earlier work , films like the double life of veronique . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and shiner , starring michael caine as an aging british boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that . 
POSITIVE:1 others , more attuned to the anarchist maxim that 'the urge to destroy is also a creative urge' , or more willing to see with their own eyes , will find morrison's iconoclastic uses of technology to be liberating . 
POSITIVE:1 leguizamo and jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie ultimately relies a bit too heavily on grandstanding , emotional , rocky-like moments . . . but it's such a warm and charming package that you'll feel too happy to argue much . 
NEGATIVE:0 safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
NEGATIVE:0 a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
POSITIVE:1 a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of hollywood's comic-book adaptations .

POSITIVE:1 told just proficiently enough to trounce its overly comfortable trappings .

POSITIVE:1 shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski's the pianist , but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high . 
POSITIVE:1 we learn a lot about dying coral and see a lot of life on the reef . 
NEGATIVE:0 comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .

POSITIVE:1 an intriguing and entertaining introduction to johnson . 
NEGATIVE:0 if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . 
NEGATIVE:0 one thing's for sure—if george romero had directed this movie , it wouldn't have taken the protagonists a full hour to determine that in order to kill a zombie you must shoot it in the head . 
NEGATIVE:0 apparently designed as a reverie about memory and regret , but the only thing you'll regret is remembering the experience of sitting through it . 
NEGATIVE:0 not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at .

NEGATIVE:0 i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
NEGATIVE:0 a well-intentioned effort that's still too burdened by the actor's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . 
NEGATIVE:0 a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it's sort of true and it's sort of bogus and it's ho-hum all the way through .

POSITIVE:1 familiar but utterly delightful . 
NEGATIVE:0 this piece of channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the best rock documentaries ever . wilco is a phenomenal band with such an engrossing story that will capture the minds and hearts of many . 
POSITIVE:1 even if you can't pronounce " gyro " correctly , you'll appreciate much of vardalos' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries . 
NEGATIVE:0 so faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban , not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check . 
POSITIVE:1 this is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are , and how to push them . 
NEGATIVE:0 soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable . 
POSITIVE:1 a heady , biting , be-bop ride through nighttime manhattan , a loquacious videologue of the modern male and the lengths to which he'll go to weave a protective cocoon around his own ego . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie doesn't add anything fresh to the myth . 
NEGATIVE:0 nothing about it fits .

POSITIVE:1 the first tunisian film i have ever seen , and it's also probably the most good-hearted yet sensual entertainment i'm likely to see all year . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this disposable tissue has one wild card , it's john turturro , who's simply fab as a spanish butler with a foot fetish .

POSITIVE:1 byler reveals his characters in a way that intrigues and even fascinates us , and he never reduces the situation to simple melodrama . 
POSITIVE:1 grenier is terrific , bringing an unforced , rapid-fire delivery to toback's heidegger- and nietzsche-referencing dialogue . 
NEGATIVE:0 the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo .

NEGATIVE:0 it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving .

POSITIVE:1 tells a fascinating , compelling story . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
NEGATIVE:0 every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
POSITIVE:1 as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness . her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant . 
POSITIVE:1 one hour photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director mark romanek's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .

NEGATIVE:0 like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior . . . circuit gets drawn into the party .

POSITIVE:1 half submarine flick , half ghost story , all in one criminally neglected film
POSITIVE:1 a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian-israeli director dover kosashvili . 
NEGATIVE:0 mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values .

POSITIVE:1 schütte's dramatic snapshot of the artist three days before his death offers an interesting bit of speculation as to the issues brecht faced as his life drew to a close .

POSITIVE:1 [raimi's] matured quite a bit with spider-man , even though it's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you'll ever see .

NEGATIVE:0 despite a performance of sustained intelligence from stanford and another of subtle humour from bebe neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich new york intelligentsia - and its off
NEGATIVE:0 co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .

POSITIVE:1 a slick , well-oiled machine , exquisitely polished and upholstered . 
POSITIVE:1 topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0 vera's technical prowess ends up selling his film short ; he smoothes over hard truths even as he uncovers them . 
POSITIVE:1 the performances are amiable and committed , and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye .

NEGATIVE:0 no amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script . 
NEGATIVE:0 chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
POSITIVE:1 two hours of melodramatic musical married to two hours of underdog sports intrigue , if the picture also shares the weaknesses of both genres , more's the pity . 
NEGATIVE:0 good for a few unintentional laughs , " extreme ops " was obviously made for the " xxx " crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction . 
NEGATIVE:0 no such thing is sort of a minimalist beauty and the beast , but in this case the beast should definitely get top billing . robert john burke as the monster horns in and steals the show . 
POSITIVE:1 the mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs . 
NEGATIVE:0 the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
POSITIVE:1 the movie , despite its rough edges and a tendency to sag in certain places , is wry and engrossing . 
NEGATIVE:0 [lee] treats his audience the same way that jim brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects . and lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception . 
NEGATIVE:0 the animation is competent , and some of the gags are quite funny , but jonah . . . never shakes the oppressive , morally superior good-for-you quality that almost automatically accompanies didactic entertainment . 
NEGATIVE:0 storytelling feels slight . 
POSITIVE:1 opening with some contrived banter , cliches and some loose ends , the screenplay only comes into its own in the second half . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen . 
POSITIVE:1 imagine o . henry's <b>the gift of the magi</b> relocated to the scuzzy underbelly of nyc's drug scene . merry friggin' christmas ! 
POSITIVE:1 the entire cast is extraordinarily good . 
NEGATIVE:0 partly a schmaltzy , by-the-numbers romantic comedy , partly a shallow rumination on the emptiness of success -- and entirely soulless . 
POSITIVE:1 this riveting world war ii moral suspense story deals with the shadow side of american culture : racial prejudice in its ugly and diverse forms . 
POSITIVE:1 the chateau belongs to rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting french malapropisms . . . is a nonstop hoot . 
POSITIVE:1 one of the more intelligent children's movies to hit theaters this year . 
POSITIVE:1 it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . 
NEGATIVE:0 what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
NEGATIVE:0 director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
NEGATIVE:0 exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair . 
POSITIVE:1 intensely romantic , thought-provoking and even an engaging mystery . 
NEGATIVE:0 'the war of the roses , ' trailer-trash style . entertaining but like shooting fish in a barrel . 
NEGATIVE:0 yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . 
NEGATIVE:0 how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
POSITIVE:1 vividly conveys the shadow side of the 30-year friendship between two english women . 
NEGATIVE:0 being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film . 
POSITIVE:1 the tasteful little revision works wonders , enhancing the cultural and economic subtext , bringing richer meaning to the story's morals . 
POSITIVE:1 the filmmakers try to balance pointed , often incisive satire and unabashed sweetness , with results that are sometimes bracing , sometimes baffling and quite often , and in unexpected ways , touching . 
NEGATIVE:0 a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation . 
NEGATIVE:0 meandering and confusing . 
POSITIVE:1 good , solid storytelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . 
POSITIVE:1 no screen fantasy-adventure in recent memory has the showmanship of clones' last 45 minutes . 
POSITIVE:1 a strangely compelling and brilliantly acted psychological drama . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's hackneyed message is not helped by the thin characterizations , nonexistent plot and pretentious visual style . 
NEGATIVE:0 buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
POSITIVE:1 for the first time in years , de niro digs deep emotionally , perhaps because he's been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars . 
NEGATIVE:0 an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
NEGATIVE:0 'in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
POSITIVE:1 this is the kind of subject matter that could so easily have been fumbled by a lesser filmmaker , but ayres makes the right choices at every turn . 
POSITIVE:1 evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children--and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good . 
NEGATIVE:0 so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
NEGATIVE:0 sit through this one , and you won't need a magic watch to stop time ; your dvd player will do it for you . 
POSITIVE:1 i walked away from this new version of e . t . just as i hoped i would -- with moist eyes . 
POSITIVE:1 there's just something about watching a squad of psychopathic underdogs whale the tar out of unsuspecting lawmen that reaches across time and distance . 
NEGATIVE:0 its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . 
NEGATIVE:0 take away all the cliches and the carbon copy scenes from every drug movie we've seen and all you have left are john leguizamo's cool jackets . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bravura exercise in emptiness . 
NEGATIVE:0 time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
NEGATIVE:0 when not wallowing in its characters' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems . 
POSITIVE:1 a subtle , humorous , illuminating study of politics , power and social mobility . 
NEGATIVE:0 this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
NEGATIVE:0 a movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you can't wait to see end . 
NEGATIVE:0 chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 a sobering and powerful documentary about the most severe kind of personal loss : rejection by one's mother . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion . 
POSITIVE:1 a fascinating case study of flower-power liberation -- and the price that was paid for it . 
POSITIVE:1 veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures . 
NEGATIVE:0 a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
POSITIVE:1 just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat . 
NEGATIVE:0 simply doesn't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time . 
POSITIVE:1 see scratch for the history , see scratch for the music , see scratch for a lesson in scratching , but , most of all , see it for the passion . 
NEGATIVE:0 rarely has a film's title served such dire warning . 
NEGATIVE:0 ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
POSITIVE:1 although it includes a fair share of dumb drug jokes and predictable slapstick , " orange county " is far funnier than it would seem to have any right to be . 
POSITIVE:1 offers a persuasive look at a defeated but defiant nation in flux . 
POSITIVE:1 viveka seldahl and sven wollter will touch you to the core in a film you will never forget -- that you should never forget . 
POSITIVE:1 this engrossing , characteristically complex tom clancy thriller is shifty in the manner in which it addresses current terrorism anxieties and sidesteps them at the same time . 
POSITIVE:1 manages to please its intended audience -- children -- without placing their parents in a coma-like state . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly won't win any honors . 
NEGATIVE:0 though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
POSITIVE:1 a breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is a hoot , and is just as good , if not better than much of what's on saturday morning tv especially the pseudo-educational stuff we all can't stand . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
NEGATIVE:0 under-rehearsed and lifeless
NEGATIVE:0 home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice . 
NEGATIVE:0 hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
POSITIVE:1 a deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish . 
NEGATIVE:0 does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . 
POSITIVE:1 for veggietales fans , this is more appetizing than a side dish of asparagus . if you're not a fan , it might be like trying to eat brussels sprouts . 
POSITIVE:1 touché ! 
NEGATIVE:0 one lousy movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 the moviegoing equivalent of going to a dinner party and being forced to watch the host and hostess's home video of their baby's birth . 
NEGATIVE:0 while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast . 
NEGATIVE:0 with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
NEGATIVE:0  " my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! " yes , you are , ben kingsley . 
NEGATIVE:0 complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold . 
POSITIVE:1 the film's constant mood of melancholy and its unhurried narrative are masterfully controlled . but … in trying to capture the novel's deeper intimate resonances , the film has – ironically - distanced us from the characters . 
NEGATIVE:0 another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues . 
NEGATIVE:0 coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit . 
NEGATIVE:0 the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . 
POSITIVE:1 sweet and memorable film . 
NEGATIVE:0 dogtown is hollow , self-indulgent , and - worst of all - boring . 
POSITIVE:1 the difference between cho and most comics is that her confidence in her material is merited . 
POSITIVE:1 the dragons are the real stars of reign of fire and you won't be disappointed . 
NEGATIVE:0 his comedy premises are often hackneyed or just plain crude , calculated to provoke shocked laughter , without following up on a deeper level . 
POSITIVE:1 a gorgeous , witty , seductive movie . 
NEGATIVE:0 national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
POSITIVE:1 morton is a great actress portraying a complex character , but morvern callar grows less compelling the farther it meanders from its shocking start . 
POSITIVE:1 insomnia is one of the year's best films and pacino gives one of his most daring , and complicated , performances . 
POSITIVE:1 a pretty funny movie , with most of the humor coming , as before , from the incongruous but chemically perfect teaming of crystal and de niro . 
POSITIVE:1 as banal as the telling may be -- and at times , all my loved ones more than flirts with kitsch -- the tale commands attention . 
POSITIVE:1 the first shocking thing about sorority boys is that it's actually watchable . even more baffling is that it's funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
POSITIVE:1 too often , son of the bride becomes an exercise in trying to predict when a preordained " big moment " will occur and not " if . " 
NEGATIVE:0 certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic . 
NEGATIVE:0 some stunning visuals -- and some staggeringly boring cinema . 
POSITIVE:1 it makes compelling , provocative and prescient viewing . 
NEGATIVE:0 at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
POSITIVE:1 like a veteran head cutter , barbershop is tuned in to its community . 
POSITIVE:1 more than their unique residences , home movie is about the people who live in them , who have carved their own comfortable niche in the world and have been kind enough to share it . 
NEGATIVE:0 a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is reasonably entertaining , though it begins to drag two-thirds through , when the melodramatic aspects start to overtake the comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn't seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point . 
POSITIVE:1 both a successful adaptation and an enjoyable film in its own right . 
POSITIVE:1 stuart's poor-me persona needs a whole bunch of snowball's cynicism to cut through the sugar coating . but once the falcon arrives in the skies above manhattan , the adventure is on red alert . 
POSITIVE:1 george lucas returns as a visionary with a tale full of nuance and character dimension . 
NEGATIVE:0 the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . 
NEGATIVE:0 some body often looks like an episode of the tv show blind date , only less technically proficient and without the pop-up comments . 
POSITIVE:1 so many documentaries like this presuppose religious bigotry or zealous nuttiness of its antagonists , but family fundamentals displays a rare gift for unflinching impartiality . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's something with potential here , but the movie decides , like lavinia , to go the conservative route . 
POSITIVE:1 an almost unbearably morbid love story . 
NEGATIVE:0 the big-screen scooby makes the silly original cartoon seem smart and well-crafted in comparison . 
NEGATIVE:0 to be influenced chiefly by humanity's greatest shame , reality shows -- reality shows for god's sake ! -- is a crime that should be punishable by chainsaw . 
POSITIVE:1 rouge is less about a superficial midlife crisis than it is about the need to stay in touch with your own skin , at 18 or 80 . 
POSITIVE:1 it strikes hardest… when it reminds you how pertinent its dynamics remain . fifty years after the fact , the world's political situation seems little different , and [director phillip] noyce brings out the allegory with remarkable skill . 
NEGATIVE:0 the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
POSITIVE:1 for the most part , the film does hold up pretty well . 
NEGATIVE:0 the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
POSITIVE:1 the film starts out as competent but unremarkable . . . and gradually grows into something of considerable power . 
NEGATIVE:0 some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being . 
POSITIVE:1 worth a look by those on both sides of the issues , if only for the perspective it offers , one the public rarely sees . 
NEGATIVE:0 shows moments of promise but ultimately succumbs to cliches and pat storytelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 unlike trey parker , sandler doesn't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself . 
NEGATIVE:0 flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
NEGATIVE:0 although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
POSITIVE:1 this documentary is a dazzling , remarkably unpretentious reminder of what [evans] had , lost , and got back . 
POSITIVE:1 a worthy addition to the cinematic canon , which , at last count , numbered 52 different versions . 
NEGATIVE:0 as saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses . 
POSITIVE:1 everywhere the camera looks there is something worth seeing . 
NEGATIVE:0 skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
POSITIVE:1 those outside show business will enjoy a close look at people they don't really want to know . 
POSITIVE:1 intriguing and stylish . 
NEGATIVE:0 humor in i spy is so anemic . 
NEGATIVE:0 sluggish , tonally uneven . 
POSITIVE:1 proves mainly that south korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their hollywood counterparts . 
POSITIVE:1 there are times when a rumor of angels plays like an extended episode of touched by an angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but i liked its heart and its spirit . 
POSITIVE:1 count on his movie to work at the back of your neck long after you leave the theater . 
POSITIVE:1 be prepared to cling to the edge of your seat , tense with suspense . the ring never lets you off the hook . 
POSITIVE:1 some remarkable achival film about how shanghai ( of all places ) served jews who escaped the holocaust . 
POSITIVE:1  " antwone fisher " is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington . it won't rock any boats but is solid meat-and-potatoes filmmaking . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 . 
NEGATIVE:0 a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
NEGATIVE:0 although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
POSITIVE:1 those prone to indignation need not apply ; those susceptible to blue hilarity , step right up . 
NEGATIVE:0 the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
POSITIVE:1 4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it's the ultimate redneck road-trip . 
POSITIVE:1 too sincere to exploit its subjects and too honest to manipulate its audience . 
NEGATIVE:0 heavy with flabby rolls of typical toback machinations . 
POSITIVE:1 if the film has a problem , its shortness disappoints : you want the story to go on and on . 
POSITIVE:1 labute's careful handling makes the material seem genuine rather than pandering . 
NEGATIVE:0 becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that doesn't and a thriller that won't . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects — from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
POSITIVE:1  " me without you " is a probing examination of a female friendship set against a few dynamic decades . 
NEGATIVE:0 fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent . 
POSITIVE:1 over-the-top and a bit ostentatious , this is a movie that's got oodles of style and substance . 
NEGATIVE:0 it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
NEGATIVE:0 audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
NEGATIVE:0 just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be . 
POSITIVE:1 an intimate contemplation of two marvelously messy lives . 
NEGATIVE:0 some body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling . 
POSITIVE:1 a wild ride of a movie that keeps throwing fastballs . 
POSITIVE:1 quite simply , a joy to watch and--especially--to listen to . 
POSITIVE:1 return to never land may be another shameless attempt by disney to rake in dough from baby boomer families , but it's not half-bad . 
NEGATIVE:0 the script kicks in , and mr . hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow . 
POSITIVE:1 remarkably accessible and affecting . 
NEGATIVE:0 chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about . 
NEGATIVE:0 the good girl is a film in which the talent is undeniable but the results are underwhelming . 
POSITIVE:1 the weight of the piece , the unerring professionalism of the chilly production , and the fascination embedded in the lurid topic prove recommendation enough . 
POSITIVE:1 in addition to gluing you to the edge of your seat , changing lanes is also a film of freshness , imagination and insight . 
POSITIVE:1 a charming , banter-filled comedy . . . one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface . 
NEGATIVE:0 despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
POSITIVE:1 with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
NEGATIVE:0 [tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the united states . the movie is the equivalent of french hip-hop , which also seems to play on a 10-year delay . 
POSITIVE:1 cool gadgets and creatures keep this fresh . not as good as the original , but what is . . . 
POSITIVE:1 it's a film that's destined to win a wide summer audience through word-of-mouth reviews and , not far down the line , to find a place among the studio's animated classics . 
NEGATIVE:0 the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
POSITIVE:1 spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing . 
POSITIVE:1 the four feathers has rewards , from the exoticism of its seas of sand to the fierce grandeur of its sweeping battle scenes . 
NEGATIVE:0 mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor . 
POSITIVE:1 the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
NEGATIVE:0 solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
NEGATIVE:0 plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
NEGATIVE:0 well-made but mush-hearted . 
NEGATIVE:0 the sweetest thing leaves a bitter taste . 
POSITIVE:1 the sundance film festival has become so buzz-obsessed that fans and producers descend upon utah each january to ferret out the next great thing . 'tadpole' was one of the films so declared this year , but it's really more of the next pretty good thing . 
NEGATIVE:0 the plot meanders from gripping to plodding and back . 
POSITIVE:1 third time's the charm . . . yeah , baby ! 
POSITIVE:1 despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity . 
POSITIVE:1 directed with purpose and finesse by england's roger mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as notting hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft . 
NEGATIVE:0 shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . 
POSITIVE:1 real women may have many agendas , but it also will win you over , in a big way . 
POSITIVE:1 blessed with two fine , nuanced lead performances . 
NEGATIVE:0 it plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness . 
POSITIVE:1 it's not particularly subtle . . . however , it still manages to build to a terrifying , if obvious , conclusion . 
POSITIVE:1 though writer/director bart freundlich's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of crudup's anchoring performance . 
POSITIVE:1 not the kind of film that will appeal to a mainstream american audience , but there is a certain charm about the film that makes it a suitable entry into the fest circuit . 
POSITIVE:1 a mostly intelligent , engrossing and psychologically resonant suspenser . 
POSITIVE:1 charles' entertaining film chronicles seinfeld's return to stand-up comedy after the wrap of his legendary sitcom , alongside wannabe comic adams' attempts to get his shot at the big time . 
NEGATIVE:0 trouble every day is a success in some sense , but it's hard to like a film so cold and dead . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground . 
POSITIVE:1 fantastic ! 
NEGATIVE:0 the problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum . a rumor of angels doesn't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness . 
NEGATIVE:0 a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
NEGATIVE:0 this film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own . 
NEGATIVE:0 a mimetic approximation of better films like contempt and 8 1/2 . 
NEGATIVE:0 as a movie , it never seems fresh and vital . it never plays as dramatic even when dramatic things happen to people . it labours as storytelling . 
NEGATIVE:0 we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . 
POSITIVE:1 what emerges is an unsettling picture of childhood innocence combined with indoctrinated prejudice . promises is a compelling piece that demonstrates just how well children can be trained to live out and carry on their parents' anguish . 
NEGATIVE:0 ms . phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either esther's initial anomie or her eventual awakening . 
NEGATIVE:0 acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
POSITIVE:1 the most ingenious film comedy since being john malkovich . 
NEGATIVE:0 es triste tener que decirles que lo único grato de la cinta es el cuerpo desnudo de la heather . . . 
NEGATIVE:0 was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ? 
POSITIVE:1 there's nothing more satisfying during a summer of event movies than a spy thriller like the bourne identity that's packed with just as much intelligence as action . 
NEGATIVE:0 when a movie asks you to feel sorry for mick jagger's sex life , it already has one strike against it . 
NEGATIVE:0 to say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor . 
NEGATIVE:0 it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . 
NEGATIVE:0 staggers between flaccid satire and what is supposed to be madcap farce . 
NEGATIVE:0 [a] mess . 
POSITIVE:1 mr . polanski is in his element here : alone , abandoned , but still consoled by his art , which is more than he has ever revealed before about the source of his spiritual survival . 
POSITIVE:1 another one of those estrogen overdose movies like " divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood , " except that the writing , acting and character development are a lot better . 
POSITIVE:1 it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients . 
NEGATIVE:0 while it's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records ( sugar hill gang , etc . ) , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences . 
POSITIVE:1 insomnia is involving . still , i thought it could have been more . 
NEGATIVE:0 city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
POSITIVE:1 you live the mood rather than savour the story . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness . 
NEGATIVE:0 there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . 
NEGATIVE:0 each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
POSITIVE:1 clint eastwood's blood work is a lot like a well-made pb& j sandwich : familiar , fairly uneventful and boasting no real surprises – but still quite tasty and inviting all the same . 
POSITIVE:1 land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored . 
POSITIVE:1 by its modest , straight-ahead standards , undisputed scores a direct hit . 
NEGATIVE:0 harland williams is so funny in drag he should consider permanent sex-reassignment . 
NEGATIVE:0 an ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . the kind of movie you see because the theater has air conditioning . 
NEGATIVE:0 some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent . 
POSITIVE:1 É uma pena que , mais tarde , o próprio filme abandone o tom de paródia e passe a utilizar os mesmos clichês que havia satirizado . 
POSITIVE:1 you could love safe conduct ( laissez passer ) for being a subtitled french movie that is 170 minutes long . you could hate it for the same reason . 
POSITIVE:1 a smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy . 
POSITIVE:1 hayek is stunning as frida and . . . a star-making project . 
NEGATIVE:0 the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
POSITIVE:1 the film is delicately narrated by martin landau and directed with sensitivity and skill by dana janklowicz-mann . 
POSITIVE:1 puts a refreshing and comical spin on the all-too-familiar saga of the contemporary single woman . 
POSITIVE:1 while not as aggressively impressive as its american counterpart , " in the bedroom , " moretti's film makes its own , quieter observations
NEGATIVE:0 the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller . 
NEGATIVE:0  . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar . 
NEGATIVE:0 unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , impostor is opening today at a theater near you . 
POSITIVE:1 disney has always been hit-or-miss when bringing beloved kids' books to the screen . . . tuck everlasting is a little of both . 
NEGATIVE:0 if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . 
POSITIVE:1 it trusts the story it sets out to tell . 
NEGATIVE:0 the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
NEGATIVE:0 much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset .
