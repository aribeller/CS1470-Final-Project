# CNN for Sentence Classification
By Ari Beller and Nicholas Lum

# Running the code
The following dependencies are required to run the code:
* Python 2.7
* Tensorflow
* `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz`, found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing

The network can be run with the following command and parameters:

`python2 text-classifier <param 1> <param 2> <param 3> <param 4> <param 5>`

Where the parameters are as follows:
* <params 1>: The training data filepath
* <params 2>: The testing data filepath
* <params 3>: The embeddings filepath
* <params 4>: The word `MAKE` or `USE. `MAKE` to create the embeddings from the pretrained vectors and save it to the given embeddings filepath; `USE` to use the vectors previously saved in the given embedding file.
* <params 5>: The training data filepath
