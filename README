# cnn for sentence classification
by Ari Beller and Nicholas Lum

## Using gooogle news pretrained

### The model itself
Download it at https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit

Place it in a the folder that contains the project folder,
i.e. its relative filepath to the project folder should be `../GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin`

### Loading in python
Download gensim: https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim -
`pip install gemsim` or `sudo -H pip install gensim` if the previous did not work

Example at: https://gist.github.com/bhaettasch/d7f4e22e79df3c8b6c20 or see notes folder

Load model: `pretrained = gs.models.KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format(PRETRAINED_filepath, binary=True)`

It takes roughly a minute to load the entire file (for me).

Get embedding for word: `pretrained['dog']`.
