POSITIVE:0.69444 Reign of Fire may be little more than another platter of reheated Aliens , but it 's still pretty tasty .
POSITIVE:0.70833 There are times when A Rumor of Angels plays like an extended episode of Touched by an Angel -- a little too much dancing , a few too many weeping scenes -- but I liked its heart and its spirit .

POSITIVE:0.76389 Sturdy , entertaining period drama ... both Caine and Fraser have their moments .
NEUTRAL:0.54167 Whether -LRB- Binoche and Magimel -RRB- are being charming or angst-ridden , they easily fill their scenes and , fine judges both , never overcook the hysteria .

NEGATIVE:0.30556 The story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -LRB- and torturing -RRB- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .
VERY_POSITIVE:0.81944 It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .
NEUTRAL:0.5 So I just did .

NEUTRAL:0.45833 This charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make Jay and Silent Bob 's Excellent Adventure seem understated .

NEGATIVE:0.33333 The subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .
NEGATIVE:0.375 ... Hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Unlike his directorial efforts , La Femme Nikita and The Professional , The Transporter lacks Besson 's perspective as a storyteller .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 The overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.13889 Most of the supporting characters in Eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 This one 's weaker than most .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the Castro regime in less than saintly tones .

NEGATIVE:0.33333 You can practically smell the patchouli oil .
NEUTRAL:0.41667 To say Analyze That is De Niro 's best film since Meet the Parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 The actors do n't inhabit their roles -- they 're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 An often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
NEGATIVE:0.375 This film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than Ali G
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
NEUTRAL:0.59722 There is no insight into the anguish of Heidi 's life -- only a depiction of pain , today 's version of Greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.125 The editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.097222 When -LRB- De Palma 's -RRB- bad , he 's really bad , and Femme Fatale ranks with the worst he has done .
NEUTRAL:0.44444 Tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : Young is cool , and too young is too cool .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 I doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time Christmas really rolls around , but maybe it 'll be on video by then .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity Short Cuts by way of Very Bad Things .
NEUTRAL:0.45833 All 's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.083333 The only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill Hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 If you think that Jennifer Lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry Ben Affleck , wait till you see Maid in Manhattan .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Stars Matthew Perry and Elizabeth Hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately Serving Sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 It 's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit Cherish .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .
NEUTRAL:0.51389 In the end , Ted Bundy 's only justification is the director 's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there 's no larger point , and little social context .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 ... -LRB- like -RRB- channel surfing between the Discovery Channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .
NEGATIVE:0.25 A movie that , rather than skip along the Seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca-Asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 Imagine a really bad community theater production of West Side Story without the songs .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.15278 Soul is what 's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 A one-trick pony whose few T&A bits still ca n't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable .
NEUTRAL:0.41667 The worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
NEUTRAL:0.52778 It may be a prize winner , but Teacher is a bomb .
POSITIVE:0.63889 The production values are up there .
VERY_POSITIVE:0.90278 The use of CGI and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick .
POSITIVE:0.625 The voices are fine as well .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .
NEUTRAL:0.48611 It 's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 Proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Well , it does go on forever .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 This overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the Rush Hour crowd .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Topkapi this is not .

VERY_NEGATIVE:0.15278 While the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .
VERY_POSITIVE:0.80556 If you liked the 1982 film then , you 'll still like it now .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 A 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode TV series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .

NEGATIVE:0.36111 She lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 Audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.15278 To imagine the life of Harry Potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized Woody Allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is Kung Pow : Enter the Fist .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for Deeper Meaning .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 Credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 I would have preferred a transfer down the hall to Mr. Holland 's class for the music , or to Robin Williams 's lecture so I could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
NEUTRAL:0.56944 For the most part , the ingredients are there .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 But an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents Nettelbeck 's film from coming together .

NEUTRAL:0.58333 Yes , one enjoys seeing Joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering Philip only diminishes her stature .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 It 's a film that hinges on its casting , and Glover really does n't fit the part .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 This is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.027778 ... with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , I realized this is a throwaway movie that wo n't stand the test of time .
NEUTRAL:0.54167 It 's a trifle .
NEUTRAL:0.55556 Literally nothing in The Pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980 's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Arguably the year 's silliest and most incoherent movie .
NEUTRAL:0.41667 Anyway , for one reason or another , Crush turns into a dire drama partway through .

NEGATIVE:0.34722 A mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.11111 The film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Marries the amateurishness of The Blair Witch Project with the illogic of Series 7 : The Contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 The Piano Teacher is the sort of movie that discourages American audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .
NEUTRAL:0.55556 If it 's another regurgitated action movie you 're after , there 's no better film than Half Past Dead .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 So what is the point ?

NEGATIVE:0.33333 This is junk food cinema at its greasiest .
VERY_POSITIVE:0.86111 When it 's all wet , Blue Crush is highly enjoyable .

VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 Some , like Ballistic , arrive stillborn ... looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .

NEGATIVE:0.25 The charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre .
NEUTRAL:0.54167 But what about the countless other people who 'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?
NEGATIVE:0.31944 A silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Scarlet Diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it 's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 The character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and Clayburgh does n't always improve the over-the-top mix .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as Morvern 's thick , working-class Scottish accent .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 Lame , haphazard teen comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 It 's the kind of movie that ends up festooning U.S. art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it 's in French -LRB- well , mostly -RRB- with English subtitles and is magically ` significant ' because of that .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.097222 This miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing Flatbush machismo will get it through .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially Seven , which director William Malone slavishly copies .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative cliches and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It 's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that Hollywood is n't laughing with us , folks .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 It 's laughing at us .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Might have been better off as a documentary , with less of Mr. Eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .

NEGATIVE:0.27778 Arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
NEUTRAL:0.40278 Both awful and appealing .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
NEGATIVE:0.25 We are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Helmer DeVito ... attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids ' TV and revenge .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.13889 It would n't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $ 7.00 .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.013889 I hated every minute of it .

NEUTRAL:0.47222 Kidman is really the only thing that 's worth watching in Birthday Girl , a film by the stage-trained Jez Butterworth -LRB- Mojo -RRB- that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of British comedies in the post-Full Monty world .

VERY_POSITIVE:0.83333 Excellent acting and direction .

NEGATIVE:0.29167 Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .

NEGATIVE:0.38889 Quick : who wants to see a comedy about shoddy airport security ?
NEUTRAL:0.5 The reason I found myself finally unmoved by this film , which is immaculately produced and has serious things to say , is that it comes across rather too plainly as allegory .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 What you get with Empire is a movie you 've seen many times before , repackaged as new material because there is a Latino in the lead .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- I 'm not one of them .

VERY_NEGATIVE:0.15278 Needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
NEUTRAL:0.44444 The problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , Mr. Desplechin is content to state it .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 Madonna still ca n't act a lick .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Even the imaginative gore ca n't hide the musty scent of Todd Farmer 's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 Alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .
NEGATIVE:0.375 If you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .

VERY_POSITIVE:0.80556 Serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in America in 2002 .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 But hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Do n't let your festive spirit go this far .

NEGATIVE:0.30556 McKay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.027778 A recipe for cinematic disaster ... part Quentin Tarantino , part Guy Ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it 's all bad .
NEUTRAL:0.40278 The cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie 's power as a work of drama .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Another big , dumb action movie in the vein of XXX , The Transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black BMW through .
NEUTRAL:0.45833 Aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with Townsend .

NEGATIVE:0.26389 The pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film ca n't help but go soft and stinky .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 For all its alleged youthful fire , XXX is no less subservient to Bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 A predictable and stereotypical little B-movie .

NEUTRAL:0.5 Just how extreme are these ops ?
NEGATIVE:0.36111 I regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 The actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 John Leguizamo may be a dramatic actor -- just not in this movie .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 The sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
NEUTRAL:0.43056 Hardly makes the kind of points Egoyan wanted to make , nor does it exist as the kind of monument he wanted to build , to victims whose voices have never gained the ears of the world .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.097222 The Master Of Disaster - it 's a piece of dreck disguised as comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... Alas , Santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the Snowman -LRB- who never gets to play that flute -RRB- has all the charm of a meltdown .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.0 The stupidest , most insulting movie of 2002 's first quarter .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 It 's so underwritten that you ca n't figure out just where the other characters , including Ana 's father and grandfather , come down on the issue of Ana 's future .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 A film so tedious that it is impossible to care whether that boast is true or not .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 None of this violates the letter of Behan 's book , but missing is its spirit , its ribald , full-throated humor .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 Bad Company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
NEUTRAL:0.47222 Even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission 's worth of funny to keep it afloat .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Fails to bring as much to the table .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 A film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy Hollywood caper flick .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 Disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 If you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
