NEUTRAL:0.47222 A movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Corpus Collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in .

NEGATIVE:0.34722 If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of God , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 There are simply too many ideas floating around -- part farce , part Sliding Doors , part pop video -- and yet failing to exploit them .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.11111 It takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of Robert Forster , Anne Meara , Eugene Levy , and Reginald VelJohnson all in the same movie .

NEGATIVE:0.27778 Sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest .

VERY_NEGATIVE:0.125 Unfortunately , it 's not silly fun unless you enjoy really bad movies .
NEUTRAL:0.43056 The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it 's actually pretty good in the first few minutes .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 While it 's genuinely cool to hear characters talk about early rap records -LRB- Sugar Hill Gang , etc. -RRB- , the constant referencing of hip-hop arcana can alienate even the savviest audiences .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.11111 Not only unfunny , but downright repellent .

VERY_NEGATIVE:0.15278 It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
NEUTRAL:0.48611 The stripped-down approach does give the film a certain timeless quality , but the measured pace and lack of dramatic inflection can also seem tedious .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .

NEUTRAL:0.55556 It 's not without its pleasures , but I 'll stick with The Tune .
POSITIVE:0.79167 Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .

NEUTRAL:0.40278 More maudlin than sharp .

NEGATIVE:0.22222 Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .
NEUTRAL:0.40278 A cheerful enough but imminently forgettable rip-off of -LRB- Besson 's -RRB- earlier work .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.15278 A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
POSITIVE:0.76389 ... routine , harmless diversion and little else .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Late Marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .
POSITIVE:0.61111 While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
NEGATIVE:0.20833 It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
NEUTRAL:0.5 Let 's hope -- shall we ?
NEGATIVE:0.30556 There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.125 Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
POSITIVE:0.625 A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .
NEUTRAL:0.47222 The actors are appealing , but Elysian Fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.069444 The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .
NEUTRAL:0.44444 With an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , Soderbergh 's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
NEUTRAL:0.47222 Denis O'Neill 's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.097222 A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
NEUTRAL:0.40278 Like the Chelsea 's denizens ... Burdette 's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .
NEUTRAL:0.40278 It 's basically an overlong episode of Tales from the Crypt .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
NEUTRAL:0.43056 I ca n't quite recommend it -- it 's too patched together -- but I almost can ; it 's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
NEGATIVE:0.375 Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
POSITIVE:0.61111 Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.13889 Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Bad .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.055556 Very bad .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.055556 Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .
NEUTRAL:0.51389 The messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated Old Testament tale of Jonah and the Whale .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .
NEUTRAL:0.47222 Historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
NEUTRAL:0.5 Long Time Dead ?
NEUTRAL:0.47222 Not nearly long enough .
NEUTRAL:0.52778 Nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .
POSITIVE:0.66667 A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
POSITIVE:0.63889 McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .
NEUTRAL:0.47222 Skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .
NEUTRAL:0.52778 Who needs love like this ?
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .
NEUTRAL:0.44444 Returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , Sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .
NEUTRAL:0.59722 Exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.13889 Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
NEGATIVE:0.25 It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
NEUTRAL:0.55556 Whenever its story is n't bogged down by idiocy involving the CIA and a lost U.S. satellite , Hunter -- starring Irwin and his American wife\/colleague , Terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.13889 Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 I 'm just too bored to care .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
NEUTRAL:0.41667 As befits its title , this PG-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the Snuggle Fabric Softener bear .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
NEUTRAL:0.41667 A beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.055556 This is so bad .
NEUTRAL:0.40278 Even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .
NEUTRAL:0.48611 I felt sad for Lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by Rohmer , for example .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.18056 The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
NEUTRAL:0.5 Van Wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase ` comedy gag . '
NEGATIVE:0.25 At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The end result is a film that 's neither .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Something like scrubbing the toilet .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Or emptying rat traps .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .
POSITIVE:0.72222 Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 \/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !
NEGATIVE:0.375 Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
NEGATIVE:0.23611 There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.19444 The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 But it could have been worse .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.125 Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
VERY_NEGATIVE:0.16667 comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 ... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
NEUTRAL:0.44444 Sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
