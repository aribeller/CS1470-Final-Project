NEGATIVE:0.16667 There 's no energy .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !
NEGATIVE:0.34722 At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .

NEGATIVE:0.18056 There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .
POSITIVE:0.72222 It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
NEGATIVE:0.25 All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .
POSITIVE:0.65278 Good performances keep it from being a total rehash .
NEGATIVE:0.375 The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .

NEGATIVE:0.15278 Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Go , girls , right down the reality drain .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .
POSITIVE:0.65278 Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 ` Matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy .
POSITIVE:0.83333 At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 Run for your lives !
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
NEGATIVE:0.36111 A grating , emaciated flick .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
POSITIVE:0.66667 According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Ararat feels like a book report
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
NEGATIVE:0.0 The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about
NEGATIVE:0.19444 The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 The problem with the mayhem in Formula 51 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliche .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
POSITIVE:0.63889 The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
POSITIVE:0.94444 If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
POSITIVE:0.68056 With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 51 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
NEGATIVE:0.25 A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .
POSITIVE:0.61111 Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . '
NEGATIVE:0.23611 This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
NEGATIVE:0.027778 You 'll cry for your money back .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 Slap me , I saw this movie .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 -LRB- The kid 's -RRB- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Scherfig , who has had a successful career in TV , tackles more than she can handle .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material
NEGATIVE:0.30556 They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '
NEGATIVE:0.027778 So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into cliches .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Five screenwriters are credited with the cliche-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .
NEGATIVE:0.375 The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people .
NEGATIVE:0.25 It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .
POSITIVE:0.65278 Ken Russell would love this .
NEGATIVE:0.25 In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
NEGATIVE:0.25 A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the Bollywood films .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .
POSITIVE:0.69444 The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .
NEGATIVE:0.027778 The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Opera on film is never satisfactory .
POSITIVE:0.73611 The art demands live viewing .
NEGATIVE:0.125 The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
POSITIVE:0.66667 As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The story has little wit and no surprises .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
NEGATIVE:0.125 What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ?
NEGATIVE:0.29167 A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 -LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself .
POSITIVE:0.69444 A quaint , romanticized rendering .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Been there done that .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
NEGATIVE:0.125 A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .
NEGATIVE:0.25 We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .
POSITIVE:0.68056 Bravado Kathy !
NEGATIVE:0.27778 ... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Too bad .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 This romantic\/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
NEGATIVE:0.25 It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Co-writer\/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 An uninspired preachy and cliched war film .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this Orgasm -LRB- wo n't be an -RRB- exceedingly memorable one for most people .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .

NEGATIVE:0.125 It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Does n't really add up to much .

NEGATIVE:0.33333 Never inspires more than an interested detachment .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .

NEGATIVE:0.041667 In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The script is too mainstream and the psychology too textbook to intrigue .
NEGATIVE:0.375 A disaster of a drama , saved only by its winged assailants .

NEGATIVE:0.27778 Upper West Sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 On its icy face , the new film is a subzero version of Monsters , Inc. , without the latter 's imagination , visual charm or texture .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 I ca n't say this enough : This movie is about an adult male dressed in pink jammies .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 It 's a mindless action flick with a twist -- far better suited to video-viewing than the multiplex .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 After a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through The Country Bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .

NEGATIVE:0.16667 Epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made Tucker a star .

NEGATIVE:0.34722 This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .
NEGATIVE:0.375 ... built on the premise that middle-class Arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from TV reruns and supermarket tabloids .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 A laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .

NEGATIVE:0.013889 One of the worst films of 2002 .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .
NEGATIVE:0.375 High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .

NEGATIVE:0.29167 The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .

NEGATIVE:0.22222 After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 ` Linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... '

NEGATIVE:0.25 It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .

NEGATIVE:0.22222 The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''
NEGATIVE:0.11111 A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .

NEGATIVE:0.34722 Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .
POSITIVE:0.66667 Oh , look at that clever angle !
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
POSITIVE:0.61111 It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .
POSITIVE:0.875 Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
POSITIVE:0.73611 -LRB- Gayton 's script -RRB- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 A ragbag of cliches .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .
POSITIVE:0.625 Short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight ... Tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 What more can be expected from a college comedy that 's target audience has n't graduated from junior high school ?
NEGATIVE:0.15278 The plan to make Enough into ` an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller ' has flopped as surely as a souffle gone wrong .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Instead of letting the laughs come as they may , Lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Just send it to Cranky .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .

NEGATIVE:0.23611 The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .

NEGATIVE:0.16667 There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .

NEGATIVE:0.20833 The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 -LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
POSITIVE:0.65278 Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .
NEGATIVE:0.25 A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 They cheapen the overall effect .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
NEGATIVE:0.125 The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 More a gunfest than a Rock concert .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 It makes me say the obvious : Abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 It 's not original enough .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 I still want my money back .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
NEGATIVE:0.375 All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of cliches , depression and bad alternative music .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .
NEGATIVE:0.25 A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
NEGATIVE:0.125 With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .

NEGATIVE:0.25 Formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
NEGATIVE:0.375 They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Rather less than the sum of its underventilated pere-fils confrontations .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .

NEGATIVE:0.055556 You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .

POSITIVE:0.65278 Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .

NEGATIVE:0.26389 An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .

NEGATIVE:0.22222 Like Schindler 's List , The Grey Zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .
NEGATIVE:0.027778 An unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the DV revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 It 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Friday After Next is a lot more bluster than bite .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 There are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .

NEGATIVE:0.16667 Here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked souffle .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 `` Sorority Boys '' was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 A bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids ' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder
NEGATIVE:0.375 Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .
POSITIVE:0.72222 Often likable , but just as often it 's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 Certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , Eight Crazy Nights is a total misfire .
POSITIVE:0.625 Elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .
