NEGATIVE:0.069444 The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .

NEGATIVE:0.26389 But seriously , folks , it does n't work .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 -LRB- A -RRB- painfully flat gross-out comedy ...
NEGATIVE:0.125 Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .
NEGATIVE:0.25 It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
NEGATIVE:0.375 I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 It drowns in sap .
POSITIVE:0.70833 Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .
NEGATIVE:0.375 The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .
POSITIVE:0.83333 Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder by Numbers -RRB- , the movie is powerful and provocative .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie cliches .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 The material and the production itself are little more than routine .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
NEGATIVE:0.125 It 's all surface psychodramatics .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 The Mothman Prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .

NEGATIVE:0.27778 Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .
NEGATIVE:0.25 There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's Razzie .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman ca n't save it .

NEGATIVE:0.25 Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 SC2 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .
POSITIVE:0.875 It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Suffers from a flat script and a low budget .
POSITIVE:0.65278 There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 This franchise has not spawned a single good film .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 The crap continues .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .

NEGATIVE:0.33333 I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` Tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 A stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .

NEGATIVE:0.125 A tired , unnecessary retread ... a stale copy of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with .

NEGATIVE:0.36111 Ear-splitting exercise in formula crash-and-bash action .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 The emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Schaefer 's ... determination to inject farcical raunch ... drowns out the promise of the romantic angle .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Like Showgirls and Glitter , the most entertaining moments here are unintentional .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 While some of the camera work is interesting , the film 's mid-to-low budget is betrayed by the surprisingly shoddy makeup work .

NEGATIVE:0.34722 The first hour is tedious though Ford and Neeson capably hold our interest , but its just not a thrilling movie .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 -LRB- Green is -RRB- the comedy equivalent of Saddam Hussein , and I 'm just about ready to go to the U.N. and ask permission for a preemptive strike .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 No amount of good acting is enough to save Oleander 's uninspired story .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Murphy and Wilson actually make a pretty good team ... but the project surrounding them is distressingly rote .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Think The Lion King redone for horses , with fewer deliberate laughs , more inadvertent ones and stunningly trite songs by Bryan Adams , the world 's most generic rock star .

NEGATIVE:0.097222 An amateurish , quasi-improvised acting exercise shot on ugly digital video .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The holes in this film remain agape -- holes punched through by an inconsistent , meandering , and sometimes dry plot .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Would Benigni 's Italian Pinocchio have been any easier to sit through than this hastily dubbed disaster ?
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Officially , it is twice as bestial but half as funny .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 This is a fragmented film , once a good idea that was followed by the bad idea to turn it into a movie .
POSITIVE:0.73611 Mindless yet impressively lean spinoff of last summer 's bloated effects fest The Mummy Returns .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It 's replaced by some dramatic scenes that are jarring and deeply out of place in what could have -LRB- and probably should have -RRB- been a lighthearted comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 Control-Alt-Delete Simone as quickly as possible
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Follows the original film virtually scene for scene and yet manages to bleed it almost completely dry of humor , verve and fun .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Has lost some of the dramatic conviction that underlies the best of comedies ...
NEGATIVE:0.375 Vaguely interesting , but it 's just too too much .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 ... no charm , no laughs , no fun , no reason to watch .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 A generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Kung Pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after Oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 A manipulative feminist empowerment tale thinly posing as a serious drama about spousal abuse .
POSITIVE:0.77778 Everything in Maid in Manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend .
POSITIVE:0.72222 It goes down easy , leaving virtually no aftertaste .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 A profoundly stupid affair , populating its hackneyed and meanspirited storyline with cardboard characters and performers who value cash above credibility .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Time stands still in more ways that one in Clockstoppers , a sci-fi thriller as lazy as it is interminable .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 As a director , Eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 A puzzle whose pieces do not fit .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Would that Greengrass had gone a tad less for grit and a lot more for intelligibility .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 ` Butterfingered ' is the word for the big-fisted direction of Jez Butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Be forewarned , if you 're depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 a terrible adaptation of a play that only ever walked the delicate tightrope between farcical and loathsome .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 In the wrong hands , i.e. Peploe 's , it 's simply unbearable
NEGATIVE:0.31944 An inexperienced director , Mehta has much to learn .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 A limp Eddie Murphy vehicle that even he seems embarrassed to be part of .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 So muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker 's characteristic style .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 A gushy episode of `` M \* A \* S \* H '' only this time from an Asian perspective .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 `` Looking For Leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Nothing more than four or five mild chuckles surrounded by 86 minutes of overly-familiar and poorly-constructed comedy .
POSITIVE:0.72222 Definitely in the guilty pleasure B-movie category , Reign of Fire is so incredibly inane that it is laughingly enjoyable .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 ... one resurrection too many .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 This is a film about the irksome , tiresome nature of complacency that remains utterly satisfied to remain the same throughout .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Even as the hero of the story rediscovers his passion in life , the mood remains oddly detached .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 In spite of featuring a script credited to no fewer than five writers , apparently nobody here bothered to check it twice .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 No one involved , save Dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director Abdul Malik Abbott and Ernest ` Tron ' Anderson , seems entirely improvised .
POSITIVE:0.61111 Initially gripping , eventually cloying POW drama .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 A timid , soggy near miss .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Works better in the conception than it does in the execution ... winds up seeming just a little too clever .
NEGATIVE:0.375 To the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Shunji Iwai 's All About Lily Chou Chou is a beautifully shot , but ultimately flawed film about growing up in Japan .
NEGATIVE:0.375 With more character development this might have been an eerie thriller ; with better payoffs , it could have been a thinking man 's monster movie .
NEGATIVE:0.125 There 's not a single jump-in-your-seat moment and believe it or not , Jason actually takes a backseat in his own film to special effects .
POSITIVE:0.77778 Goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing ... but she and writing partner Laurence Coriat do n't manage an equally assured narrative coinage .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Though Harris is affecting at times , he can not overcome the sense that Pumpkin is a mere plot pawn for two directors with far less endearing disabilities .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 The documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc. -- to do the subject matter justice .
NEGATIVE:0.375 The movie itself appears to be running on hypertime in reverse as the truly funny bits get further and further apart .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 This is not a Jackie Chan movie .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It 's just a movie that happens to have Jackie Chan in it .
POSITIVE:0.65278 And that makes all the difference .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Far too clever by half , Howard 's film is really a series of strung-together moments , with all the spaces in between filled with fantasies , daydreams , memories and one fantastic visual trope after another .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 The problem with movies about angels is they have a tendency to slip into hokum .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 A Rumor of Angels does n't just slip -- it avalanches into forced fuzziness .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 No big whoop , nothing new to see , zero thrills , too many flashbacks and a choppy ending make for a bad film .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 I do n't think this movie loves women at all .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .

NEGATIVE:0.31944 Fails to convince the audience that these brats will ever be anything more than losers .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Slack and uninspired , and peopled mainly by characters so unsympathetic that you 're left with a sour taste in your mouth .
NEGATIVE:0.027778 Skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you 're sure to get more out of the latter experience .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Her film is like a beautiful food entree that is n't heated properly , so that it ends up a bit cold and relatively flavorless .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Like the world of his film , Hartley created a monster but did n't know how to handle it .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 No new plot conceptions or environmental changes , just different bodies for sharp objects to rip through .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 In the end , there is n't much to it .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 A waste of fearless purity in the acting craft .
NEGATIVE:0.375 The film is ultimately about as inspiring as a Hallmark card .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Anyone not into high-tech splatterfests is advised to take the warning literally , and log on to something more user-friendly .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-Brits genre that was ushered in by The Full Monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 for those for whom the name Woody Allen was once a guarantee of something fresh , sometimes funny , and usually genuinely worthwhile , Hollywood Ending is a depressing experience
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Femme Fatale offers nothing more than a bait-and-switch that is beyond playing fair with the audience .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Are we dealing with dreams , visions or being told what actually happened as if it were the third ending of Clue ?
NEGATIVE:0.18056 It could have been something special , but two things drag it down to mediocrity -- director Clare Peploe 's misunderstanding of Marivaux 's rhythms , and Mira Sorvino 's limitations as a classical actress .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Fluffy neo-noir hiding behind cutesy film references .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Imagine Susan Sontag falling in love with Howard Stern .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor .

NEGATIVE:0.36111 These guys seem great to knock back a beer with but they 're simply not funny performers .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 Everything was as superficial as the forced New Jersey lowbrow accent Uma had .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Director David Fincher and writer David Koepp ca n't sustain it .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Director Shekhar Kapur and screenwriters Michael Schiffer and Hossein Amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Strong filmmaking requires a clear sense of purpose , and in that oh-so-important category , The Four Feathers comes up short .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 A grand fart coming from a director beginning to resemble someone 's crazy French grandfather .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 The script is a disaster , with cloying messages and irksome characters .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Hollywood has taken quite a nosedive from Alfred Hitchcock 's imaginative flight to Shyamalan 's self-important summer fluff .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 The film 's maudlin focus on the young woman 's infirmity and her naive dreams play like the worst kind of Hollywood heart-string plucking .
POSITIVE:0.75 I firmly believe that a good video game movie is going to show up soon .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 I also believe that Resident Evil is not it .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 It has the air of a surprisingly juvenile lark , a pop-influenced prank whose charms are immediately apparent and wear thin with repetition .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 This is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 No amount of nostalgia for Carvey 's glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carvey 's considerable talents are wasted in it .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Lazily directed by Charles Stone III ... from a leaden script by Matthew Cirulnick and novelist Thulani Davis .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Though Jones and Snipes are enthralling , the movie bogs down in rhetoric and cliche .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 An artsploitation movie with too much exploitation and too little art .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 The pacing is often way off and there are too many bona fide groaners among too few laughs .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Barely manages for but a few seconds over its seemingly eternal running time to pique your interest , your imagination , your empathy or anything , really , save your disgust and your indifference .
POSITIVE:0.65278 Writer\/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky , with mixed results .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .

NEGATIVE:0.11111 is a mess .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Hypnotically dull , relentlessly downbeat , laughably predictable wail pitched to the cadence of a depressed fifteen-year-old 's suicidal poetry .
POSITIVE:0.75 The concept is a hoot .
POSITIVE:0.80556 The trailer is a riot .
NEGATIVE:0.013889 The movie is a dud .
POSITIVE:0.65278 It 's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 It 's hard to imagine another director ever making his wife look so bad in a major movie .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 These characters become wearisome .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 A hit - and-miss affair , consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as Cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 This may be the first cartoon ever to look as if it were being shown on the projection television screen of a sports bar .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Kim Ki-Deok seems to have in mind an -LRB- emotionally at least -RRB- adolescent audience demanding regular shocks and bouts of barely defensible sexual violence to keep it interested .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 After sitting through this sloppy , made-for-movie comedy special , it makes me wonder if Lawrence hates criticism so much that he refuses to evaluate his own work .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Contrived pastiche of caper cliches .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Despite its sincere acting , Signs is just another unoriginal run of the mill sci-fi film with a flimsy ending and lots of hype .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Loud , chaotic and largely unfunny .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Qualities that were once amusing are becoming irritating .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Well , Jason 's gone to Manhattan and Hell , I guess a space station in the year 2455 can be crossed off the list of ideas for the inevitable future sequels -LRB- hey , do n't shoot the messenger -RRB- .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Donovan ... squanders his main asset , Jackie Chan , and fumbles the vital action sequences .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 There is no psychology here , and no real narrative logic -- just a series of carefully choreographed atrocities , which become strangely impersonal and abstract .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Bread , My Sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Leaks treacle from every pore .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 The characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue CIA assassins working for Chris Cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n't feel much for Damon\/Bourne or his predicament .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Kapur weighs down the tale with bogus profundities .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Blue Crush is as predictable as the tides .
NEGATIVE:0.25 ... The movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then Blood Work is for you .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Trouble Every Day is a success in some sense , but it 's hard to like a film so cold and dead .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Any reasonably creative eighth-grader could have written a more credible script , though with the same number of continuity errors .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 ... while the humor aspects of ` Jason X ' were far more entertaining than I had expected , everything else about the film tanks .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Like an Afterschool Special with costumes by Gianni Versace , Mad Love looks better than it feels .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 The script , the gags , the characters are all direct-to-video stuff , and that 's where this film should have remained .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 A thriller without thrills and a mystery devoid of urgent questions .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 There are some laughs in this movie , but Williams ' anarchy gets tiresome , the satire is weak .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 As steamy as last week 's pork dumplings .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The somber pacing and lack of dramatic fireworks make Green Dragon seem more like medicine than entertainment .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 The filmmakers needed more emphasis on the storytelling and less on the glamorous machine that thrusts the audience into a future they wo n't much care about .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 Another wholly unnecessary addition to the growing , moldering pile of , well , extreme stunt pictures .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 This strenuously unfunny Showtime deserves the hook .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The whole thing 's fairly lame , making it par for the course for Disney sequels .
