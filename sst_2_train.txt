POSITIVE:0.76389 Earnest , unsubtle and Hollywood-predictable , Green Dragon is still a deeply moving effort to put a human face on the travail of thousands of Vietnamese .
POSITIVE:0.80556 An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off .
POSITIVE:0.66667 The film 's unhurried pace is actually one of its strengths .
POSITIVE:0.69444 Entirely appropriately , the tale unfolds like a lazy summer afternoon and concludes with the crisp clarity of a fall dawn .
POSITIVE:0.875 Despite its floating narrative , this is a remarkably accessible and haunting film .

POSITIVE:0.80556 Sweetly sexy , funny and touching .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 ... while Dark Water is n't a complete wash -LRB- no pun intended -RRB- , watched side-by-side with Ringu , it ultimately comes off as a pale successor .

POSITIVE:0.75 Together writer-director Danny Verete 's three tales comprise a powerful and reasonably fulfilling gestalt .
POSITIVE:0.80556 Bursting through the constraints of its source , this is one adapted - from-television movie that actually looks as if it belongs on the big screen .

NEGATIVE:0.31944 In other words , it 's just another sports drama\/character study .

POSITIVE:0.83333 Like Shrek , Spirit 's visual imagination reminds you of why animation is such a perfect medium for children , because of the way it allows the mind to enter and accept another world .
POSITIVE:0.88889 A modestly made but profoundly moving documentary .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It irritates and saddens me that Martin Lawrence 's latest vehicle can explode obnoxiously into 2,500 screens while something of Bubba Ho-Tep 's clearly evident quality may end up languishing on a shelf somewhere .

POSITIVE:0.79167 The dragons are the real stars of Reign of Fire and you wo n't be disappointed .
POSITIVE:0.91667 Kudos to the most enchanting film of the year .
POSITIVE:0.73611 It works well enough , since the thrills pop up frequently , and the dispatching of the cast is as often imaginative as it is gory .
POSITIVE:0.86111 It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .
POSITIVE:0.77778 Director Paul Cox 's unorthodox , abstract approach to visualizing Nijinsky 's diaries is both stimulating and demanding .

POSITIVE:0.69444 A film that 's flawed and brilliant in equal measure .
POSITIVE:0.75 Even if Invincible is not quite the career peak that The Pianist is for Roman Polanski , it demonstrates that Werner Herzog can still leave us with a sense of wonder at the diverse , marvelously twisted shapes history has taken .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to American art house audiences , but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness .
POSITIVE:0.72222 Hardly a film that comes along every day .
POSITIVE:0.80556 A wild ride with eight boarders from Venice Beach that was a deserved co-winner of the Audience Award for documentaries at the Sundance Film Festival .
POSITIVE:0.72222 A sweet , tender sermon about a 12-year-old Welsh boy more curious about God than girls , who learns that believing in something does matter .
POSITIVE:0.72222 the film belongs to the marvelous Verdu , a sexy slip of an earth mother who mourns her tragedies in private and embraces life in public
POSITIVE:0.84722 More intimate than spectacular , E.T. is carried less by wow factors than by its funny , moving yarn that holds up well after two decades .
POSITIVE:0.72222 For once , a movie does not proclaim the truth about two love-struck somebodies , but permits them time and space to convince us of that all on their own .
POSITIVE:0.65278 If you 're burnt out on It 's a Wonderful Life marathons and bored with A Christmas Carol , it might just be the movie you 're looking for .
POSITIVE:0.72222 Moonlight Mile does n't quite go the distance but the cast is impressive and they all give life to these broken characters who are trying to make their way through this tragedy .
POSITIVE:0.66667 Not as well-written as Sexy Beast , not as gloriously flippant as Lock , Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , but stylish and moody and exceptionally well-acted .

NEGATIVE:0.38889 Paul Cox needed to show it .

POSITIVE:0.95833 There are n't too many films that can be as simultaneously funny , offbeat and heartwarming -LRB- without a thick shmear of the goo , at least -RRB- , but `` Elling '' manages to do all three quite well , making it one of the year 's most enjoyable releases .
POSITIVE:0.73611 Reign of Fire is hardly the most original fantasy film ever made -- beyond Road Warrior , it owes enormous debts to Aliens and every previous dragon drama -- but that barely makes it any less entertaining .
POSITIVE:0.75 An earnest , roughshod document , it serves as a workable primer for the region 's recent history , and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool .

POSITIVE:0.77778 Tadpole may be one of the most appealing movies ever made about an otherwise appalling , and downright creepy , subject -- a teenage boy in love with his stepmother .
POSITIVE:0.95833 This is a story that zings all the way through with originality , humour and pathos .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 As underwater ghost stories go , Below casts its spooky net out into the Atlantic Ocean and spits it back , grizzled and charred , somewhere northwest of the Bermuda Triangle .
POSITIVE:0.72222 Trapped wo n't score points for political correctness , but it may cause parents a few sleepless hours -- a sign of its effectiveness .
POSITIVE:0.72222 A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .
POSITIVE:0.66667 It 's incredible the number of stories the Holocaust has generated .

POSITIVE:0.65278 Happily , some things are immune to the folly of changing taste and attitude .
POSITIVE:0.75 For proof of that on the cinematic front , look no further than this 20th anniversary edition of the film that Spielberg calls , retrospectively , his most personal work yet .
POSITIVE:0.94444 Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .
POSITIVE:0.68056 It 's not like having a real film of Nijinsky , but at least it 's better than that eponymous 1980 biopic that used soap in the places where the mysteries lingered .
POSITIVE:0.70833 It 's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 If only it had the story to match .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 It 's quite diverting nonsense .
POSITIVE:0.77778 An old-fashioned scary movie , one that relies on lingering terror punctuated by sudden shocks and not constant bloodshed punctuated by flying guts .
POSITIVE:0.69444 For all the wit and hoopla , Festival In Cannes offers rare insight into the structure of relationships .

POSITIVE:0.86111 Swimming is above all about a young woman 's face , and by casting an actress whose face projects that woman 's doubts and yearnings , it succeeds .

POSITIVE:0.76389 I like it .
POSITIVE:0.75 There is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude , this fast-paced and this insane .
POSITIVE:0.88889 That rare documentary that incorporates so much of human experience -- drama , conflict , tears and surprise -- that it transcends the normal divisions between fiction and nonfiction film .

POSITIVE:0.79167 The evocative imagery and gentle , lapping rhythms of this film are infectious -- it gets under our skin and draws us in long before the plot kicks into gear .
POSITIVE:0.84722 Like the best of Godard 's movies ... it is visually ravishing , penetrating , impenetrable .
POSITIVE:0.66667 Horns and Halos benefits from serendipity but also reminds us of our own responsibility to question what is told as the truth .

NEGATIVE:0.33333 What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .
POSITIVE:0.68056 The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 `` Solaris '' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .

NEGATIVE:0.16667 But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid .

NEGATIVE:0.25 It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .
NEGATIVE:0.013889 This is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .

NEGATIVE:0.13889 There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .
POSITIVE:0.63889 A bold -LRB- and lovely -RRB- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .

NEGATIVE:0.36111 If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 My own minority report is that it stinks .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .

NEGATIVE:0.11111 ... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .
NEGATIVE:0.375 While Solondz tries and tries hard , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 -LRB- Davis -RRB- wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4Ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 ... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .

NEGATIVE:0.33333 A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 The characters are based on stock cliches , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .

NEGATIVE:0.22222 Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 By that measure , it is a failure .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise .

NEGATIVE:0.11111 You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-13 rating .

NEGATIVE:0.11111 It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
NEGATIVE:0.083333 The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable

NEGATIVE:0.34722 I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .

NEGATIVE:0.26389 If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 We hate -LRB- Madonna -RRB- within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Never comes together as a coherent whole .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH1 Behind the Music episode .
NEGATIVE:0.25 First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 And second , what 's with all the shooting ?
NEGATIVE:0.083333 Do n't even bother to rent this on video .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .
NEGATIVE:0.027778 Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 A film that suffers because of its many excesses .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris .
NEGATIVE:0.375 But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Nijinsky says , ' I know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 ` CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
NEGATIVE:0.055556 The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 ... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
NEGATIVE:0.19444 It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 This action-thriller\/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
NEGATIVE:0.125 MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 That 's because relatively nothing happens .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Boyd 's screenplay -LRB- co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies -RRB- has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 A moving picture that does not move .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Romething 's really wrong with this ricture !
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .
NEGATIVE:0.25 ` God help us , but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves . '

NEGATIVE:0.375 A cartoon ?
POSITIVE:0.63889 Yes .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 No. .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 And that is where Ararat went astray .

NEGATIVE:0.38889 Eight Legged Freaks wo n't join the pantheon of great monster\/science fiction flicks that we have come to love ...
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?
NEGATIVE:0.13889 Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Average , at best , I 'm afraid .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . ''
NEGATIVE:0.18056 It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Worthy of the gong .
NEGATIVE:0.25 While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .
POSITIVE:0.63889 It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 A chiller resolutely without chills .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .
NEGATIVE:0.375 The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
NEGATIVE:0.013889 `` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor 's preposterous Titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .
POSITIVE:0.65278 Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 If you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 ... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .
POSITIVE:0.83333 Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
NEGATIVE:0.027778 The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
POSITIVE:0.63889 Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Bad and baffling from the get-go .
NEGATIVE:0.25 A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .

NEGATIVE:0.16667 This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .

NEGATIVE:0.30556 Chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -LRB- the characters ' -RRB- misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .

NEGATIVE:0.15278 It 's one pussy-ass world when even killer-thrillers revolve around group therapy sessions .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 But the power of these -LRB- subjects -RRB- is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative .

NEGATIVE:0.23611 Stealing Harvard aspires to comedic grand larceny but stands convicted of nothing more than petty theft of your time .
POSITIVE:0.73611 For this reason and this reason only -- the power of its own steadfast , hoity-toity convictions -- Chelsea Walls deserves a medal .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 With the exception of some fleetingly amusing improvisations by Cedric the Entertainer as Perry 's boss , there is n't a redeeming moment here .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It 's a grab bag of genres that do n't add up to a whole lot of sense .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Movie fans , get ready to take off ... the other direction .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 -LRB- director -RRB- O'Fallon manages to put some lovely pictures up on the big screen , but his skill at telling a story -- he also contributed to the screenplay -- falls short .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 All that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and Robert De Niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 There 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging .
POSITIVE:0.79167 Miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine .
POSITIVE:0.73611 This is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director Dario Argento -LRB- a producer here -RRB- , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 It 's slow -- very , very slow .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 It 's not the ultimate Depression-era gangster movie .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 That 's pure PR hype .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Characters still need to function according to some set of believable and comprehensible impulses , no matter how many drugs they do or how much artistic license Avary employs .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Comes ... uncomfortably close to coasting in the treads of The Bicycle Thief .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Visually rather stunning , but ultimately a handsome-looking bore , the true creativity would have been to hide Treasure Planet entirely and completely reimagine it .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 Stealing Harvard is evidence that the Farrelly Bros. -- Peter and Bobby -- and their brand of screen comedy are wheezing to an end , along with Green 's half-hearted movie career .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 There seems to be no clear path as to where the story 's going , or how long it 's going to take to get there .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 I do n't think I laughed out loud once .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 And when you 're talking about a slapstick comedy , that 's a pretty big problem .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 It 's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just ca n't get no satisfaction .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler 's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $ 40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ?
NEGATIVE:0.027778 ... turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 The notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 My reaction in a word : disappointment .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 His last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Sustains its dreamlike glide through a succession of cheesy coincidences and voluptuous cheap effects , not the least of which is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos .
POSITIVE:0.72222 Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Feels haphazard , as if the writers mistakenly thought they could achieve an air of frantic spontaneity by simply tossing in lots of characters doing silly stuff and stirring the pot .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 In its own way , Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Bunuel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
NEGATIVE:0.375 I 've always dreamed of attending Cannes , but after seeing this film , it 's not that big a deal .
NEGATIVE:0.041667 It can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 Yes , dull .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Director Uwe Boll and the actors provide scant reason to care in this crude '70s throwback .
NEGATIVE:0.375 -LRB- W -RRB- hile long on amiable monkeys and worthy environmentalism , Jane Goodall 's Wild Chimpanzees is short on the thrills the oversize medium demands .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Outer-space buffs might love this film , but others will find its pleasures intermittent .
NEGATIVE:0.0 This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is , quite frankly , an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 An occasionally funny , but overall limp , fish-out-of-water story .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 A bloated gasbag thesis grotesquely impressed by its own gargantuan aura of self-importance ...
NEGATIVE:0.15278 As A Rumor of Angels reveals itself to be a sudsy tub of supernatural hokum , not even Ms. Redgrave 's noblest efforts can redeem it from hopeless sentimentality .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 an appalling ` Ace Ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak , former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 If any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film ...
NEGATIVE:0.20833 The humor is forced and heavy-handed , and occasionally simply unpleasant .
NEGATIVE:0.25 As the latest bid in the TV-to-movie franchise game , I Spy makes its big-screen entry with little of the nervy originality of its groundbreaking small-screen progenitor .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 This is n't even Madonna 's Swept Away .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 The director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 ... the film suffers from a lack of humor -LRB- something needed to balance out the violence -RRB- ...
NEGATIVE:0.375 Burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 An overemphatic , would-be wacky , ultimately tedious sex farce .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Has all the depth of a wading pool .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 This is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The so-inept - it 's - surreal dubbing -LRB- featuring the voices of Glenn Close , Regis Philbin and Breckin Meyer -RRB- brings back memories of cheesy old Godzilla flicks .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 ... the movie is just a plain old monster .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 One long string of cliches .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Fancy a real downer ?
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Professionally speaking , it 's tempting to jump ship in January to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Nelson 's brutally unsentimental approach ... sucks the humanity from the film , leaving behind an horrific but weirdly unemotional spectacle .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 At once half-baked and overheated .
POSITIVE:0.69444 -LRB- Serry -RRB- wants to blend politics and drama , an admirable ambition .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 It 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Of course , by more objective measurements it 's still quite bad .
NEGATIVE:0.125 The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Sam Mendes has become valedictorian at the School for Soft Landings and Easy Ways Out .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Its story may be a thousand years old , but why did it have to seem like it took another thousand to tell it to us ?
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The problem with this film is that it lacks focus .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Puportedly `` Based on True Events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` Based on a True Story '' with a straight face .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 ... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !
NEGATIVE:0.16667 It 's a bad thing when a movie has about as much substance as its end credits blooper reel .
NEGATIVE:0.375 With its dogged Hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , Windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .
NEGATIVE:0.375 No aspirations to social import inform the movie version .
NEGATIVE:0.125 This is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It 's clear the filmmakers were n't sure where they wanted their story to go , and even more clear that they lack the skills to get us to this undetermined destination .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 As vulgar as it is banal .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 You wonder why Enough was n't just a music video rather than a full-length movie .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 The film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The talented and clever Robert Rodriguez perhaps put a little too much heart into his first film and did n't reserve enough for his second .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 More whiny downer than corruscating commentary .
POSITIVE:0.73611 Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Both deserve better .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Suffocated by its fussy script and uptight characters , this musty adaptation is all the more annoying since it 's been packaged and sold back to us by Hollywood .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Coughs and sputters on its own postmodern conceit .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 A wildly inconsistent emotional experience .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Sit through this one , and you wo n't need a magic watch to stop time ; your DVD player will do it for you .
NEGATIVE:0.375 A sometimes tedious film .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Teen movies have really hit the skids .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 There are plot holes big enough for Shamu the killer whale to swim through .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 ... plays like somebody spliced random moments of a Chris Rock routine into what is otherwise a cliche-riddled but self-serious spy thriller .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 What is 100 % missing here is a script of even the most elemental literacy , an inkling of genuine wit , and anything resembling acting .
POSITIVE:0.625 does paint some memorable images ... , but Makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters
NEGATIVE:0.23611 just not campy enough
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The movie , directed by Mick Jackson , leaves no cliche unturned , from the predictable plot to the characters straight out of central casting .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 It 's everything you do n't go to the movies for .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 The affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to Demme 's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled Hollywood post-production effects .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 For all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when Godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 American Chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an Indian-American would recognize .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 And the lesson , in the end , is nothing new .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 It made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director 's brother , the film trails off into inconsequentiality .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 ... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 So devoid of any kind of intelligible story that it makes films like XXX and Collateral Damage seem like thoughtful treatises
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Combining quick-cut editing and a blaring heavy metal much of the time , Beck seems to be under the illusion that he 's shooting the latest System of a Down video .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 Dragonfly has no atmosphere , no tension -- nothing but Costner , flailing away .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 It 's a buggy drag .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Works hard to establish rounded characters , but then has nothing fresh or particularly interesting to say about them .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 The action switches between past and present , but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125-year divide .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 Nonsensical , dull `` cyber-horror '' flick is a grim , hollow exercise in flat scares and bad acting .
NEGATIVE:0.0 Instead of hiding Pinocchio from critics , Miramax should have hidden it from everyone .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 Manages to be both repulsively sadistic and mundane .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 A great ensemble cast ca n't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 There ought to be a directing license , so that Ed Burns can have his revoked .
POSITIVE:0.625 The structure the film takes may find Matt Damon and Ben Affleck once again looking for residuals as this officially completes a Good Will Hunting trilogy that was never planned .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 ... a boring parade of talking heads and technical gibberish that will do little to advance the Linux cause .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Green might want to hang onto that ski mask , as robbery may be the only way to pay for his next project .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 I can take infantile humor ... but this is the sort of infantile that makes you wonder about changing the director and writer 's diapers .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 There is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 The tale of Tok -LRB- Andy Lau -RRB- , a sleek sociopath on the trail of O -LRB- Takashi Sorimachi -RRB- , the most legendary of Asian hitmen , is too scattershot to take hold .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Directed in a paint-by-numbers manner .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 A lackluster , unessential sequel to the classic Disney adaptation of J.M. Barrie 's Peter Pan .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Samira Makhmalbaf 's new film Blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness , although , it 's unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal
POSITIVE:0.76389 ... routine , harmless diversion and little else .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Late Marriage 's stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep U.S. viewers off their feet .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 This time Mr. Burns is trying something in the Martin Scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again .
POSITIVE:0.61111 While there 's something intrinsically funny about Sir Anthony Hopkins saying ` Get in the car , bitch , ' this Jerry Bruckheimer production has little else to offer
NEGATIVE:0.20833 It 's hampered by a Lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 -- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?
NEGATIVE:0.38889 I do n't think so .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 If you 've ever entertained the notion of doing what the title of this film implies , what Sex With Strangers actually shows may put you off the idea forever .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 In the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director Joe Carnahan .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 But what are adults doing in the theater at all ?
NEGATIVE:0.125 Sticky sweet sentimentality , clumsy plotting and a rosily myopic view of life in the WWII-era Mississippi Delta undermine this adaptation .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 It 's another stale , kill-by-numbers flick , complete with blade-thin characters and terrible , pun-laden dialogue .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Every time you look , Sweet Home Alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Partway through watching this saccharine , Easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected TV show .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Portentous and pretentious , The Weight of Water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .
POSITIVE:0.625 A fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of Malcolm in the Middle and its pubescent star , Frankie Muniz .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Jason X is positively anti-Darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and Jason still kills on auto-pilot .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 To say this was done better in Wilder 's Some Like It Hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 As ` chick flicks ' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 The only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 There 's no emotional pulse to Solaris .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It ca n't decide if it wants to be a mystery\/thriller , a romance or a comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 The character of ZigZag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 One of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Serving Sara does n't serve up a whole lot of laughs .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 With virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , Chelsea Walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 A misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The film makes a fatal mistake : It asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort
NEGATIVE:0.375 Though Perry and Hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by Jay Scherick and David Ronn , neither the actors nor director Reginald Hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .
POSITIVE:0.61111 Something akin to a Japanese Alice Through the Looking Glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 It takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 On the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you 're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 Makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Although Huppert 's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , The Piano Teacher is anything but fun .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It showcases Carvey 's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one 's patience to get to the good stuff .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Bad .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 Very bad .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 Stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 If looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , do n't settle for this Imposter .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Not really bad so much as distasteful : We need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 The result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a Halloween that died .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Davis ... is so enamored of her own creation that she ca n't see how insufferable the character is .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The Man From Elysian Fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 But this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .
POSITIVE:0.66667 A solid film ... but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 There 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 The X potion gives the quickly named Blossom , Bubbles and Buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately do n't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .
POSITIVE:0.63889 McConaughey 's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 An unwise amalgam of Broadcast News and Vibes .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole ' miss in the way of story .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 Trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .
NEGATIVE:0.25 It 's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it does n't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 It offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 A sequence of ridiculous shoot - 'em - up scenes .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 Nothing in Waking Up in Reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 I 'm just too bored to care .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliche left unsaid .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 It all feels like a Monty Python sketch gone horribly wrong .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Scorsese does n't give us a character worth giving a damn about .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Like being trapped at a perpetual frat party ... How can something so gross be so boring ?
NEGATIVE:0.055556 This is so bad .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Prurient playthings aside , there 's little to love about this English trifle .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 This is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 It 's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .
NEGATIVE:0.25 At least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 A disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the Bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The end result is a film that 's neither .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Every nanosecond of the The New Guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Something like scrubbing the toilet .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Or emptying rat traps .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Or doing last year 's taxes with your ex-wife .
POSITIVE:0.72222 Scooby Dooby Doo \/ And Shaggy too \/ You both look and sound great .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 \/ But Daphne , you 're too Buff \/ Fred thinks he 's tough \/ And Velma - wow , you 've lost weight !
NEGATIVE:0.375 Is the time really ripe for a warmed-over James Bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?
NEGATIVE:0.23611 There 's enough melodrama in this Magnolia Primavera to make PTA proud yet director Muccino 's characters are less worthy of Puccini than they are of daytime television .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 However it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 The humor is n't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 But it could have been worse .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , Pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Even horror fans will most likely not find what they 're seeking with Trouble Every Day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 comes off like a rejected ABC Afterschool Special , freshened up by the dunce of a Screenwriting 101 class .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 ... Designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , `` Crossroads '' instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Demands too much of most viewers .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 The story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured -LRB- and torturing -RRB- artists and consuming but impossible love that you ca n't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .
POSITIVE:0.81944 It should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The Ring just left me cold and wet like I was out in the Seattle drizzle without rainwear .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 The film seems a dead weight .

NEGATIVE:0.097222 or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''
NEGATIVE:0.15278 It is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -LRB- and an uneasy alliance , at that -RRB- .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 The story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .

NEGATIVE:0.16667 The Sum of All Fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there 's something cringe-inducing about seeing an American football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .
NEGATIVE:0.375 The title Trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you 're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .

NEGATIVE:0.22222 ... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
NEGATIVE:0.375 It 's often faintly amusing , but the problems of the characters never become important to us , and the story never takes hold .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 There 's no denying the elaborateness of the artist 's conceptions , nor his ability to depict them with outrageous elan , but really the whole series is so much pretentious nonsense , lavishly praised by those who equate obscurity with profundity .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Characters wander into predictably treacherous situations even though they should know better .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 There 's plenty of style in Guillermo Del Toro 's sequel to the 1998 hit but why do we need 117 minutes to tell a tale that simply ca n't sustain more than 90 minutes .

NEGATIVE:0.027778 A sour , nasty offering .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Feels like one of those contrived , only-in - Hollywood productions where name actors deliver big performances created for the sole purpose of generating Oscar talk .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Earnest falls short of its Ideal predecessor largely due to Parker 's ill-advised meddling with the timeless source material .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 The film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .

NEGATIVE:0.25 I kept thinking over and over again , ' I should be enjoying this . '
NEGATIVE:0.38889 But I was n't .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 As conceived by Mr. Schaeffer , Christopher and Grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The essential problem in Orange County is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .

NEGATIVE:0.18056 The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution .

NEGATIVE:0.33333 In the second half of the film , Frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The furious coherence that -LRB- DeNiro -RRB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 Extremely dumb .

NEGATIVE:0.27778 The acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with Csokas particularly unconnected .

NEGATIVE:0.083333 A turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Too silly to be frightening , too stolid to be funny , it projects the same lazy affability as its nominal star , David Arquette .

NEGATIVE:0.31944 All that -LRB- Powerpuff Girls -RRB- charm is present in the movie , but it 's spread too thin .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Collateral Damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 \/ 11 , an antique , in the end .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 As are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Dawdles and drags when it should pop ; it does n't even have the virtue of enough mindless violence to break up the tedium of all its generational bonding .

NEGATIVE:0.38889 Life is a crock -- or something like it .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Made by jackasses for jackasses .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Despite a powerful portrayal by Binoche , it 's a period romance that suffers from an overly deliberate pace and uneven narrative momentum .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 The picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Bartleby is a one-joke movie , and a bad joke at that .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 A bravura exercise in emptiness .

NEGATIVE:0.375 First good , then bothersome .
POSITIVE:0.83333 Excellent acting and direction .
NEGATIVE:0.25 This goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring
NEGATIVE:0.041667 It 's difficult to say whether The Tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- I 'm prepared to call it a draw .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 So routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated Final Draft computer program .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Sunshine State lacks the kind of dynamic that Limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Even legends like Alfred Hitchcock and John Huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like Zhang Yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 A long-winded , predictable scenario .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Too close to Phantom Menace for comfort .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard Jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Too clunky and too busy ribbing itself to be truly entertaining .
NEGATIVE:0.25 It smacks of purely commercial motivation , with no great love for the original .

NEGATIVE:0.25 The picture , scored by a perversely cheerful Marcus Miller accordion\/harmonica\/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Good for a few unintentional laughs , `` Extreme Ops '' was obviously made for the `` XXX '' crowd , people who enjoy mindless action without the benefit of decent acting , writing , and direction .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 ... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 A frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 As written by Michael Berg and Michael J. Wilson from a story by Wilson , this relentless , all-wise-guys-all-the-time approach tries way too hard and gets tiring in no time at all .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Will probably stay in the shadow of its two older , more accessible Qatsi siblings .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Just when the movie seems confident enough to handle subtlety , it dives into soapy bathos .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .

NEGATIVE:0.041667 When a film is created SOLELY because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Let your silly childhood nostalgia slumber unmolested .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Unfortunately , Heartbreak Hospital wants to convey the same kind of haughtiness in its own sketchy material but this territory has already been explored previously with better aplomb and sardonic wit .

POSITIVE:0.69444 The latest installment in the Pokemon canon , Pokemon 4ever is surprising less moldy and trite than the last two , likely because much of the Japanese anime is set in a scenic forest where Pokemon graze in peace .

NEGATIVE:0.36111 If this is satire , it 's the smug and self-congratulatory kind that lets the audience completely off the hook .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 These people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .

NEGATIVE:0.38889 Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Any rock pile will do for a set .

NEGATIVE:0.20833 Its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 As an actor , The Rock is aptly named .
NEGATIVE:0.25 A mostly tired retread of several other mob tales .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 I wish I could say `` Thank God It 's Friday '' , but the truth of the matter is I was glad when it was over .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Nothing about it fits .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 As it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become G.I. Jane .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Consider the title 's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
NEGATIVE:0.375 I tried to read the time on my watch .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 The film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in Chinese history : war , revolution , Communism , etc. .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` What 's the point ? '
NEGATIVE:0.33333 The two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but was n't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 The movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 There 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Even by dumb action-movie standards , Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever is a dumb action movie .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Just a bloody mess .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 You would be better off investing in the worthy EMI recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 Malfitano-Domingo production .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Bears is bad .

NEGATIVE:0.27778 Here 's a self-congratulatory 3D IMAX rah-rah .
POSITIVE:0.81944 Eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 But even a hero can stumble sometimes .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 A sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .
POSITIVE:0.63889 It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The impact of the Armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Going to the website may be just as fun -LRB- and scary -RRB- as going to the film .

NEGATIVE:0.15278 Leave these Flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 For Caine Lovers only .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 A shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 De Niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to Clint Eastwood in the lazy Bloodwork .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 But like Bruce Springsteen 's gone-to-pot Asbury Park , New Jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a City of ruins .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 No , it 's not nearly as good as any of its influences .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Human Nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
POSITIVE:0.69444 City by the Sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : It 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 But what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 What could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 A bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 -LRB- k -RRB- statement .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 The whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 And forget about any attempt at a plot !
NEGATIVE:0.16667 It 's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic Oliver Parker intends to mangle next time .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Showtime is closer to Slowtime .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It may be an easy swipe to take , but this Barbershop just does n't make the cut .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 The Weight of Water uses water as a metaphor for subconscious desire , but this leaky script barely stays afloat .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director Peter Mattei 's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Barely goes beyond comic book status .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 It 's disappointing when filmmakers throw a few big-name actors and cameos at a hokey script .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 I Spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
POSITIVE:0.76389 An eccentric little comic\/thriller deeply in love with its own quirky personality .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , All the Queen 's Men is finally just one long drag .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Maybe it 's the star power of the cast or the redundant messages , but something aboul `` Full Frontal '' seems , well , contrived .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Safe Conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull 's - eye .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 My response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Maybe I found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 It 's push-the-limits teen comedy , the type written by people who ca n't come up with legitimate funny , and it 's used so extensively that good bits are hopelessly overshadowed .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 A movie that tries to fuse the two ` woods ' but winds up a Bolly-Holly masala mess .
POSITIVE:0.76389 Mr. Wedge and Mr. Saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Their film falters , however , in its adherence to the Disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that I 'd hoped the movie would avoid .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Watching it is rather like an overlong visit from a large group of your relatives .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 As your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Unfortunately , as a writer , Mr. Montias is n't nearly as good to his crew as he is as a director or actor .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 On the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... It 's just going to take more than a man in a Bullwinkle costume to get there .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 One of those movies where you walk out of the theater not feeling cheated exactly , but feeling pandered to , which , in the end , might be all the more infuriating .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 ... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Murder By Numbers is like a couple of mediocre TV-movie - of-the-week films clumsily stuck together .
POSITIVE:0.69444 The film is surprisingly well-directed by Brett Ratner , who keeps things moving well -- at least until the problematic third act .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Warmed-over Tarantino by way of wannabe Elmore Leonard .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 -LRB- Sen 's -RRB- soap opera-ish approach undermines his good intentions .
NEGATIVE:0.125 Showtime is one of the hapless victims of the arrogant `` if we put together a wry white man and a chatty black man and give them guns , the movie will be funny '' syndrome .
POSITIVE:0.69444 It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock -LRB- since Sept. 11 -RRB- .
POSITIVE:0.72222 High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 One big blustery movie where nothing really happens .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 ... pays tribute to heroes the way Julia Roberts hands out awards -- with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 entertaining enough , but nothing new
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the `` Gadzooks ! ''
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Disreputable doings and exquisite trappings are dampened by a lackluster script and substandard performances .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 You could easily mistake it for a sketchy work-in-progress that was inexplicably rushed to the megaplexes before its time .
NEGATIVE:0.0 The thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes -LRB- of which they 'll get plenty -RRB- fills me with revulsion .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Devolves into the derivative , leaning on badly-rendered CGI effects .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 A collage of cliches and a dim echo of allusions to other films .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .
NEGATIVE:0.25 An excruciating demonstration of the unsalvageability of a movie saddled with an amateurish screenplay .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 How many more times will indie filmmakers subject us to boring , self-important stories of how horrible we are to ourselves and each other ?
NEGATIVE:0.013889 A thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` The Thing ' and a geriatric ` Scream . '
NEGATIVE:0.041667 ... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 ... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Something must have been lost in the translation .
NEGATIVE:0.25 What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past Seagal films .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Muddled , simplistic and more than a little pretentious .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 What could have been right at home as a nifty plot line in Steven Soderbergh 's Traffic fails to arrive at any satisfying destination .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 The movie is like Scorsese 's Mean Streets redone by someone who ignored it in favor of old ` juvenile delinquent ' paperbacks with titles like Leather Warriors and Switchblade Sexpot .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Enigma lacks it .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Potty-mouthed enough for PG-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
POSITIVE:0.625 Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .
NEGATIVE:0.0 `` Abandon '' will leave you wanting to abandon the theater .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 This little film is so slovenly done , so primitive in technique , that it ca n't really be called animation .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ?
POSITIVE:0.77778 It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
NEGATIVE:0.097222 Press the delete key .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
POSITIVE:0.625 Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 ... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 -LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
POSITIVE:0.66667 And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
NEGATIVE:0.041667 There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .
POSITIVE:0.61111 The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Marinated in cliches and mawkish dialogue .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Whether it 's the worst movie of 2002 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 -LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Shame on writer\/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 101 .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 In other words , it 's badder than bad .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Where the film falters is in its tone .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
POSITIVE:0.66667 Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds cliches the filmmakers could dredge up .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !
POSITIVE:0.68056 It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and cliche .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 ` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
NEGATIVE:0.375 It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Hate it because it 's lousy .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 ... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
POSITIVE:0.70833 Competently directed but terminally cute drama .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Not just unlikable .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Disturbing .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Disgusting .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
NEGATIVE:0.125 This thing is virtually unwatchable .
POSITIVE:0.70833 Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows .
POSITIVE:0.69444 The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 - spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
POSITIVE:0.68056 A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/2 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .
NEGATIVE:0.25 A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
POSITIVE:0.76389 The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
POSITIVE:0.61111 The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 ... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
NEGATIVE:0.25 Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
NEGATIVE:0.375 More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The drama discloses almost nothing .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
NEGATIVE:0.125 A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
POSITIVE:0.88889 The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 -LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .

NEGATIVE:0.31944 ... a rather bland affair .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .
NEGATIVE:0.013889 All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naif 's encounter with the world .
POSITIVE:0.68056 Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 If you go , pack your knitting needles .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 We do n't even like their characters .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .
NEGATIVE:0.125 It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
NEGATIVE:0.069444 Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
POSITIVE:0.70833 - style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 A feeble Tootsie knockoff .
NEGATIVE:0.041667 An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
NEGATIVE:0.013889 ... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 -LRB- Hell is -RRB- looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 You have no affinity for most of the characters .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 Nothing about them is attractive .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
POSITIVE:0.68056 Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 ` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 How about surprising us by trying something new ?
NEGATIVE:0.18056 Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 Too bad none of it is funny .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
POSITIVE:0.66667 Oh , and more entertaining , too .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 ... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 The film is strictly routine .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 We get the comedy we settle for .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
NEGATIVE:0.041667 A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .
POSITIVE:0.625 The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .
NEGATIVE:0.29167 Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
NEGATIVE:0.375 The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
NEGATIVE:0.097222 Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
POSITIVE:0.72222 Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
NEGATIVE:0.22222 Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .
NEGATIVE:0.25 It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 ... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
NEGATIVE:0.25 The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
NEGATIVE:0.26389 This director 's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
NEGATIVE:0.19444 Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''
NEGATIVE:0.25 It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
NEGATIVE:0.083333 It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
NEGATIVE:0.18056 As pedestrian as they come .
NEGATIVE:0.38889 A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
NEGATIVE:0.055556 It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
NEGATIVE:0.36111 More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
NEGATIVE:0.375 The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .
NEGATIVE:0.20833 As saccharine as it is disposable .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
NEGATIVE:0.34722 The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 Too much power , not enough puff .
NEGATIVE:0.15278 The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
NEGATIVE:0.31944 It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
NEGATIVE:0.16667 A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
NEGATIVE:0.23611 For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Narc is all menace and atmosphere .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
NEGATIVE:0.11111 It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
NEGATIVE:0.18056 A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
NEGATIVE:0.13889 There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
NEGATIVE:0.30556 As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
NEGATIVE:0.375 Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .
POSITIVE:0.72222 `` Sweet Home Alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ...

POSITIVE:0.80556 Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
POSITIVE:0.79167 By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
POSITIVE:0.65278 Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
POSITIVE:0.68056 ` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
POSITIVE:0.79167 The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
POSITIVE:0.77778 As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .
POSITIVE:0.90278 Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
POSITIVE:0.75 Catch it ... if you can !
NEGATIVE:0.31944 American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .
POSITIVE:0.70833 ` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
POSITIVE:0.88889 It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
POSITIVE:0.65278 Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
POSITIVE:0.75 The script is smart , not cloying .
POSITIVE:0.69444 Visually , ` Santa Clause 2 ' is wondrously creative .
POSITIVE:0.80556 A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
POSITIVE:0.83333 One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
POSITIVE:0.69444 An ambitious ` what if ? '
POSITIVE:0.66667 that works .
POSITIVE:0.68056 `` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
POSITIVE:0.79167 Nice piece of work .
POSITIVE:0.68056 ` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
POSITIVE:0.75 It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
POSITIVE:0.625 Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
POSITIVE:0.68056 From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
POSITIVE:0.86111 Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
POSITIVE:0.79167 Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .

NEGATIVE:0.26389 Absolutely not .
NEGATIVE:0.013889 It sucked .
NEGATIVE:0.33333 A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
NEGATIVE:0.27778 This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .
